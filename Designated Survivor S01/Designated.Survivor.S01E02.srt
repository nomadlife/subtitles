1
00:00:00,377 --> 00:00:02,646
Previously on "Designated Survivor"...

2
00:00:02,773 --> 00:00:05,350
Capitol's been attacked. Eagle is gone.

3
00:00:05,374 --> 00:00:06,775
- Congress, the Cabinet.
- Oh, oh.

4
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:08,443
Sir, you are now the President.

5
00:00:08,478 --> 00:00:10,745
Some bad people did
something bad tonight,

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,714
and it's Dad's job to make
sure we're all safe.

7
00:00:12,748 --> 00:00:14,926
I've been with Secretary
Kirkman's staff for three years.

8
00:00:14,927 --> 00:00:16,962
It's President Kirkman now,
and you're not authorized.

9
00:00:16,986 --> 00:00:18,297
Do we know who's responsible for this?

10
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:19,554
Still too early to determine.

11
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:20,632
We got to give them something,

12
00:00:20,656 --> 00:00:21,733
the whole world is watching.

13
00:00:21,757 --> 00:00:23,925
We have a Housing and Urban
Development Secretary

14
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,960
running the free world.

15
00:00:24,994 --> 00:00:27,429
You're talking about
removing a sitting president.

16
00:00:27,463 --> 00:00:28,763
Man: We got something over here!

17
00:00:28,798 --> 00:00:29,764
Easy.

18
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:30,699
What do you see?

19
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:33,435
It's clear. Bomb's a dud.

20
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:35,403
You don't take credit for something

21
00:00:35,438 --> 00:00:36,438
until you're done, right?

22
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:39,011
So, what if they're
just getting started?

23
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:47,159
Hannah: There was no chatter.

24
00:00:47,183 --> 00:00:48,575
Jason: Hannah, I
understand there was no chatter,

25
00:00:48,576 --> 00:00:51,182
but we still need to check
all of the usual suspects...

26
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:53,488
Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Al-Sakar.

27
00:00:53,523 --> 00:00:55,457
Where are we with local law enforcement?

28
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:56,835
I've coordinated with D.C. police,

29
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:58,935
Secret Service, Metro, and Capitol.

30
00:00:58,936 --> 00:01:00,973
All right, that's good. Now,
remember... The high-value target list

31
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:02,631
only starts with the White House.

32
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:04,900
We need to heighten security
at every location.

33
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:06,935
Already taken care of.

34
00:01:12,508 --> 00:01:14,009
Man: Hey! Let's get on this bomb!

35
00:01:17,446 --> 00:01:19,114
- You taking that bomb to Andrews?
- Yeah.

36
00:01:19,148 --> 00:01:21,416
Top brass wants everything
cataloged under one roof.

37
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,652
Man: Deputy Director!
We need you over here!

38
00:01:23,686 --> 00:01:25,053
All right.

39
00:01:27,723 --> 00:01:29,958
Man: All right, pull that out!

40
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,342
Tom: My fellow Americans,

41
00:01:47,376 --> 00:01:50,512
tonight our way of life
came under attack.

42
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:53,348
This act of cowardice was meant
to cripple our nation.

43
00:01:53,382 --> 00:01:56,451
But as before,
America will show the world

44
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:58,687
that we will not bow down to fear,

45
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:02,083
that we will fight back,
that we will persevere.

46
00:02:02,084 --> 00:02:03,601
Male reporter: And this was
President Tom Kirkman's

47
00:02:03,602 --> 00:02:05,164
first address to the nation.

48
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:07,900
It came just two hours
after he was unceremoniously

49
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:09,568
sworn in as our new president.

50
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:11,403
Unfortunately, last night's speech

51
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:14,447
did little to calm the frayed nerves...

52
00:02:14,448 --> 00:02:15,327
Woman №1: Words aside,

53
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:17,886
Kirkman is an
unelected, untested HUD secretary

54
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:20,289
at a time where the world
is looking for leadership.

55
00:02:20,323 --> 00:02:21,767
Woman №2: ...remains of the Capitol,

56
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,258
searching for both survivors

57
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:24,693
and answers to the questions

58
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,061
all Americans are asking...

59
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:27,963
How did this happen

60
00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:30,599
and will life ever be the sa...

61
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:02,631
- Man: Morning, Mr. President.
- Good morning.

62
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:03,889
Tom: West Wing, right or left?

63
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,659
This way, to the right, sir.

64
00:03:05,694 --> 00:03:07,361
Thank you very much.

65
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,529
Phoenix on the move.

66
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,532
Man: Good morning, sir.

67
00:03:14,665 --> 00:03:16,514
My wife didn't want me to come in today.

68
00:03:16,538 --> 00:03:18,560
She's afraid the White House is next.

69
00:03:20,185 --> 00:03:22,286
Woman: I was supposed to go last night,

70
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,311
but I couldn't get a sitter.

71
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:26,714
What are we gonna do?

72
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,318
Melissa's dead, everyone's dead.

73
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,355
Aaron: Mr. President.

74
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:35,389
- Aaron.
- Good morning.

75
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,357
We have a briefing

76
00:03:36,391 --> 00:03:38,035
- waiting for you in the Oval, sir.
- Good.

77
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:39,793
- Mr. President.
- Wyatt, right?

78
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:41,128
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

79
00:03:41,162 --> 00:03:42,540
Aaron: Sir, I just have to warn you.

80
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:45,833
This might be a bit more hectic
than you're used to.

81
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:48,068
I-I understand. I think we'll be fine.

82
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,414
We've added increased
security to our oil and gas pipelines,

83
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,706
power grids,
refineries, chemical storage tanks.

84
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:54,408
Mass transit is still on lock down...

85
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,643
Planes and trains.

86
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:57,231
Immigration remains frozen.

87
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:58,366
Sir, you have to authorize

88
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,868
- we close the banks immediately.
- No, we can't do that.

89
00:04:00,903 --> 00:04:02,547
We cannot keep the
American people from their money.

90
00:04:02,571 --> 00:04:04,585
48 hours without Bank of America

91
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:05,717
is better than a 48-month depression.

92
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:07,719
If everyone withdraws
their money at the same time,

93
00:04:07,743 --> 00:04:08,520
the banks will collapse.

94
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:09,821
Where are we at with the bombing?

95
00:04:09,845 --> 00:04:11,987
Cochrane: Deputy Director Atwood
will be briefing us soon,

96
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:13,858
but we're looking at groups
with the skills and resources

97
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:15,354
to do something like this.

98
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,895
Hezbollah, Al-Qaeda, North Korea, RGB.

99
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:18,886
Well, what's this about
violence in Michigan?

100
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:20,988
We're getting reports
of flare-ups in Dearborn.

101
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:22,890
Police targeting the local
Muslim community.

102
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:24,492
Yeah, but what I want to know is

103
00:04:24,526 --> 00:04:25,904
how did the terrorists bring explosives

104
00:04:25,928 --> 00:04:27,641
into the Capitol Building
in the first place.

105
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,729
We're working on that.

106
00:04:28,764 --> 00:04:30,954
In the meantime, we have to
go after everyone we suspect.

107
00:04:30,955 --> 00:04:32,444
We go after them, after their families

108
00:04:32,468 --> 00:04:34,001
- any way we can.
- Emily: I'm sorry.

109
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:35,903
Are you talking about
enhanced interrogation?

110
00:04:35,938 --> 00:04:37,905
They destroyed our Capitol.

111
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,274
I'm saying we do whatever we have to do.

112
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:45,780
Man: Can I just get a moment?!

113
00:04:45,814 --> 00:04:48,382
Everybody, why don't we just
focus on one thing at a time?

114
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:51,953
Please, excuse me.

115
00:05:11,988 --> 00:05:13,954
Please, can you just give me a moment?

116
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:50,308

00:06:09,164 --> 00:06:10,765
Tom... I'm sorry.

119
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:11,999
Mr. President.

120
00:06:12,034 --> 00:06:14,116
I just needed to find somewhere quiet.

121
00:06:14,246 --> 00:06:16,420
Aaron: Yeah, admittedly,
it got a little loud in there.

122
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:17,038
Loud?

123
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:19,106
A Caps game is loud, Aaron.

124
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:21,042
Back there in the Oval
Office, that was chaos.

125
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:24,111
We need order, a system,
or this is never gonna work.

126
00:06:24,146 --> 00:06:26,147
We need to get this government
up and running.

127
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:29,500
W... We need a cabinet and fast.

128
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:31,129
That's a good idea, sir,
but first order of business

129
00:06:31,153 --> 00:06:33,020
is going to be naming
your Chief of Staff.

130
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:34,695
Seriously? You're making
a play right now?

131
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:36,157
Enough!

132
00:06:36,191 --> 00:06:38,459
I'm not ready to make that decision.

133
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:40,027
What I need is both of you to step up

134
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:41,963
and help me put together a cabinet.

135
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:43,531
Tell me you can do that.

136
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:45,700
- Yes, Mr. President.
- Of course.

137
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:46,793
Good.

138
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:48,443
For now, we're gonna close the banks.

139
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:50,312
ATMs and credit will still be available.

140
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:52,281
I want you to monitor
the situation in Michigan,

141
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:53,849
and I want you to keep me up to speed

142
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:55,484
on the investigation into the bombing.

143
00:06:55,518 --> 00:06:57,352
The American people
want to know who did this,

144
00:06:57,387 --> 00:06:59,688
- and so do I.
- Sir.

145
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,457
Also...

146
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,005
Later today, I want to see
the Capitol Building,

147
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:07,296
or what's left of it.

148
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,481
Are you sure that's a...

149
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:09,842
- good idea right now, sir?
- No, no, no.

150
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:11,510
Th... that... that's exactly
what you need, sir.

151
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:13,001
A do-over.

152
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:14,069
L-Last night's speech

153
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:15,871
didn't exactly put minds at ease.

154
00:07:15,905 --> 00:07:17,973
But you, sir, at the site...

155
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:19,041
Now that sends a message.

156
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:20,909
- It shows a...
- Respect, Aaron.

157
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:23,879
It shows respect.

158
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:25,347
It's not a photo-op.

159
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:28,450
- Whatever you say, sir.
- Good.

160
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,220
Let's get back to work.

161
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,273
Sir. Hold it right there.

162
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:58,413
Morning, what's going on?

163
00:07:58,448 --> 00:08:01,049
- What's in the backpack?
- What?

164
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:02,579
Your backpack... What's in it?

165
00:08:02,862 --> 00:08:05,763
Uh, just my stuff for, uh, work...

166
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:07,799
- Papers and stuff.
- Cop №2: Where do you work?

167
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,300
I work at the White House.

168
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:10,788
Really? The White House?

169
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,314
Yeah, you know,
where the President sleeps.

170
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:13,770
You being a wise ass?

171
00:08:13,883 --> 00:08:16,318
I'd like to know why you stopped me.

172
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:18,910
Why don't you tell us where you
live and show us some I.D. first.

173
00:08:21,013 --> 00:08:22,013
I live right there.

174
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:23,982
It's cold and it's cramped,

175
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:25,316
but I can walk to my gym,

176
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:27,118
so I got that going for me.

177
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:34,125
Cop №1: Seth Wright.

178
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,994
Is that your real name?

179
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:38,329
According to my mother.

180
00:08:38,364 --> 00:08:39,430
Cop №2: Keith.

181
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,367
This looks good.

182
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:44,002
Thanks for your cooperation, Mr. Wright.

183
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:45,336
Thank you.

184
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:48,806
Yeah, stay safe.

185
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:56,447
Look, I got to go.

186
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:57,882
Tell Mom I love her.

187
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:59,350
Okay, cabinet members.

188
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:00,416
What about Blanchard?

189
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:01,408
For State?

190
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:03,335
He's qualified... Three years as deputy.

191
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:05,237
He also has two secret Facebook accounts

192
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:07,349
and an affinity for the coeds
who look after his kids.

193
00:09:07,373 --> 00:09:08,674
I'm thinking Garfield's our guy.

194
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,450
No, think again.

195
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:12,744
He's made more than a few
enemies on the Hill.

196
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,246
Emily, I hate to break it to you,

197
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,255
but there is no Hill anymore.

198
00:09:18,284 --> 00:09:19,217
Oh, my God.

199
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:21,253
There's no Hill anymore.

200
00:09:21,287 --> 00:09:23,221
Something happened in Michigan.

201
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,190
What?

202
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:29,571
- Mr. President.
- You don't need to get up

203
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:30,739
every time I walk into a room.

204
00:09:30,763 --> 00:09:31,797
I'm not the Queen.

205
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:34,733
No, sir. Virtually no resemblance.

206
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:35,867
I'm sorry to interrupt.

207
00:09:35,902 --> 00:09:38,270
I... I actually came in to apologize.

208
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:39,304
Apologize?

209
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:41,907
Last night, you wrote me
a home run of a speech.

210
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:43,775
This morning, it seems like the press

211
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,777
wished anybody else delivered it but me.

212
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:48,447
Mr. President.

213
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:51,783
Maybe the country's just not ready, yet,

214
00:09:51,818 --> 00:09:54,319
to come together behind anyone,

215
00:09:54,354 --> 00:09:56,210
even with the best speech in the world.

216
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:57,589
Maybe.

217
00:09:57,623 --> 00:09:58,757
Aaron: Mr. President.

218
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,158
There's something you need to see.

219
00:10:00,193 --> 00:10:02,160
Woman: Police imposing a curfew

220
00:10:02,195 --> 00:10:04,496
on predominantly Muslim neighborhoods

221
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,466
and ordering residents
to obey it or face arrest.

222
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,600
These are citizens

223
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:10,635
who have not been charged
with any crimes,

224
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,636
who are simply targeted

225
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:13,505
because of their religious beliefs.

226
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:15,841
The American Civil Liberties Union

227
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,943
denounced the actions by Dearborn police

228
00:10:17,977 --> 00:10:20,812
- as a violation of an individual's...
- Mr. President, we're ready.

229
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:22,013
...basic civil rights.

230
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:24,483
But in the wake of
the attack on the Capitol,

231
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:27,319
some are saying this is
just the type of policing

232
00:10:27,353 --> 00:10:28,620
this country needs.

233
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,958
- Governor...?
- Royce.

234
00:10:32,992 --> 00:10:35,360
Governor Royce, how are you?

235
00:10:35,395 --> 00:10:36,461
Uh, about as expected.

236
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:38,497
There's a lot to manage
here, as you can imagine.

237
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:39,831
I know, and I want to help.

238
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:41,800
I've seen reports that
the police in Dearborn

239
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:43,802
are rounding up members
of the Muslim community.

240
00:10:43,836 --> 00:10:45,704
- Woman: Thank you, sir.
- Yes, I'm aware.

241
00:10:45,738 --> 00:10:48,340
Well, like I said, we'd
like to help you stop the police.

242
00:10:48,374 --> 00:10:49,541
Why would I stop the police?

243
00:10:49,575 --> 00:10:50,776
They're acting on my orders.

244
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,098
- Your orders?
- That's correct.

245
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:54,216
I don't know if you know this,

246
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:56,953
but I have the largest Muslim population
in the country, here.

247
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:59,550
That doesn't mean they're doing
anything wrong or that they've been radicalized.

248
00:10:59,553 --> 00:11:01,820
No, but I'm willing to bet
they know someone who is.

249
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,019
Governor, you can't target
an innocent population

250
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:06,353
because you're scared.

251
00:11:06,388 --> 00:11:09,156
- You have a responsibility...
- To all my citizens.

252
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,226
And my first and only priority
is to make sure they're safe,

253
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,460
something that Washington...

254
00:11:13,495 --> 00:11:15,796
If... if there even is
such a place anymore...

255
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,065
Has proven incapable of doing.

256
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:19,700
Governor, the federal government...

257
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:21,402
...was effectively
snuffed out last night.

258
00:11:21,436 --> 00:11:25,139
There is no Congress,
there is no Supreme Court.

259
00:11:25,173 --> 00:11:26,874
When it comes to the people of Michigan,

260
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:28,042
I am the highest authority,

261
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:29,877
and you have none over me.

262
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:32,379
With all due respect, sir,
I am the President.

263
00:11:32,414 --> 00:11:33,589
Not mine.

264
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:35,678
So you'll have to excuse
me, Mr. Kirkman.

265
00:11:35,712 --> 00:11:38,347
While you're busy
learning how to become President,

266
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:40,482
I've got 10 million citizens to protect.

267
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:43,085
Governor?

268
00:11:44,988 --> 00:11:46,055
Governor Royce? Hello?

269
00:12:03,678 --> 00:12:05,646
Sir, you should know
that messages of support

270
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,547
continue to pour in

271
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:08,248
from heads of state around the world.

272
00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:09,216
We should go over

273
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,951
which calls you want
to return personally.

274
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:12,111
I would think all of them.

275
00:12:12,112 --> 00:12:13,427
How many calls are we talking about?

276
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:15,207
About 175, sir.

277
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:16,641
Maybe we should prioritize.

278
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:18,543
Mr. President.

279
00:12:18,578 --> 00:12:20,045
I want you to know that I don't care

280
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,557
what the so-called pundits are saying.

281
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:23,715
I was very moved by your
words last night.

282
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:25,183
Well, thank you.

283
00:12:25,217 --> 00:12:26,828
Excuse me, but who are you?

284
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:27,896
Mr. President, this is congresswoman

285
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,022
- Kimble Hookstraten.
- Congresswoman.

286
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:34,459
Yes, I was last night's
other designated survivor.

287
00:12:35,595 --> 00:12:37,929
Other designated...

288
00:12:37,964 --> 00:12:40,432
Excuse us, please.

289
00:12:40,466 --> 00:12:41,633
Thank you, sir.

290
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:45,213
There are two designated survivors?

291
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:46,838
Yeah, the Republicans chose someone

292
00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:48,684
to sit out of the
State of the Union, as well.

293
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,774
So they'd be represented.

294
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:50,675
Smart.

295
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,510
Hey, what do you know about Hookstraten?

296
00:12:52,545 --> 00:12:54,089
Um, you were on Senator Carlyle's staff

297
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:56,091
when they were both on
Ways and Means, weren't you?

298
00:12:56,115 --> 00:12:58,016
- Stalker.
- Come on.

299
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,050
She's smart. Very smart.

300
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:01,597
Third-generation D.C. blue
blood, nine years, Republican whip,

301
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:03,688
knows every detail about
every player in town.

302
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:05,590
So you're saying she's
a lot more experienced

303
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:06,524
than the President?

304
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:10,921
Come on. Let's go get
Governor Royce on the phone.

305
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:16,234
435 representatives, 100 senators,

306
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:17,936
and 9 justices.

307
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,272
And now it's just down to the two of us.

308
00:13:20,297 --> 00:13:21,039
I know.

309
00:13:21,073 --> 00:13:23,108
You don't know
whether to feel... ashamed

310
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:24,876
or grateful to be alive.

311
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,144
Apologetic.

312
00:13:26,178 --> 00:13:27,160
Sir?

313
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:28,490
To the American people

314
00:13:28,514 --> 00:13:29,958
for being stuck with me as their leader.

315
00:13:29,982 --> 00:13:31,049
I mean, let's face it.

316
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,084
The pundits might be right.

317
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:34,019
Mr. President.

318
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:36,988
Do you know what I did
this morning, sir?

319
00:13:37,023 --> 00:13:40,725
I cried and then I prayed.

320
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,993
Do you know when the last time

321
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:44,129
I did those two things together was?

322
00:13:44,163 --> 00:13:45,230
9/11?

323
00:13:45,264 --> 00:13:48,466
Nobody thought we could
get through it back then,

324
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:49,467
but we did.

325
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:51,569
And nobody thinks we
can get through it now,

326
00:13:51,604 --> 00:13:52,904
but we will.

327
00:13:52,938 --> 00:13:55,974
This is your house now.

328
00:13:56,008 --> 00:13:57,142
So make it your own.

329
00:13:57,176 --> 00:14:00,245
Whatever you need, just ask.

330
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,614
Republican, Democrat, Independent...

331
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:05,116
It doesn't matter anymore.

332
00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:06,885
We're all Americans today.

333
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:10,989
Thank you, Congresswoman.

334
00:14:11,824 --> 00:14:13,658
Kimble, please.

335
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:14,959
Okay.

336
00:14:16,328 --> 00:14:18,263
Kimble, later this afternoon,

337
00:14:18,297 --> 00:14:22,033
I'm going to the Capitol site
to thank the first responders.

338
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:23,668
I think it would be a nice show of unity

339
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:24,969
if we were to do that together.

340
00:14:25,004 --> 00:14:26,104
What do you say?

341
00:14:26,138 --> 00:14:28,039
I'd be honored, sir.

342
00:14:28,074 --> 00:14:29,841
Thank you, Mr. President.

343
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,810
Thank you.

344
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,018
Ronnie, is that the unexploded munition?

345
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:15,720
Yep.

346
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:17,555
Hannah: What's it telling us?

347
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,057
Russian anti-tank mine,

348
00:15:19,091 --> 00:15:21,226
likely pulled from
the ground in Afghanistan.

349
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,227
But look here.

350
00:15:22,261 --> 00:15:24,929
The guts are cannibalized.

351
00:15:24,964 --> 00:15:26,231
Cyrillic on the outside,

352
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:29,100
but the lock ring is Pakistani,

353
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:32,871
and the firing pin is newer,
probably Iranian.

354
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:34,546
Well, that is
consistent with what we've seen

355
00:15:34,547 --> 00:15:36,239
from some Jihadist terror groups.

356
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,220
Well, we should be able
to point the finger directly

357
00:15:38,244 --> 00:15:39,921
when we get the lab results
from the other bombs.

358
00:15:39,945 --> 00:15:41,212
Right, but this one,

359
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:43,181
why didn't this one go off?

360
00:15:43,215 --> 00:15:44,849
Any number of reasons.

361
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:47,285
Russian red wire to Iranian
green doesn't work,

362
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:48,920
the main charge degraded.

363
00:15:48,954 --> 00:15:51,256
But I wouldn't rule out
good old-fashioned human error.

364
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,591
You're telling me that the people

365
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:56,127
who blew up our
U.S. Capitol in one shot,

366
00:15:56,162 --> 00:15:58,029
didn't test the triggers, the wiring?

367
00:15:59,298 --> 00:16:00,458
Then what are you suggesting?

368
00:16:03,102 --> 00:16:04,002
Hannah?

369
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:06,938
What if this bomb wasn't
meant to explode?

370
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:09,174
What if it was meant to be found?

371
00:16:14,132 --> 00:16:16,424
Look, I don't care what
the Governor's doing.

372
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:17,982
The President of the United Sates

373
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:19,284
needs to talk to him.

374
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:21,119
No, I'm not... I'm not asking you.

375
00:16:21,153 --> 00:16:22,153
I'm telling you.

376
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:23,331
I'm not... I'm not gonna hold.

377
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:24,890
Damn it!

378
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:26,299
You'd think there would be more people

379
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:28,205
qualified for Attorney General.

380
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,907
Seth: What the hell
am I supposed to say?

381
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:31,709
Is this a writer thing?

382
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,577
I'm trying to find a way to unite us

383
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:34,970
at Kirkman's remarks at the rubble,

384
00:16:34,972 --> 00:16:37,214
but Michigan is probably
just the beginning.

385
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:38,616
The world is falling apart.

386
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,718
Probably don't want to
put that in the speech.

387
00:16:40,752 --> 00:16:42,314
Aaron: Yes, I'm still here.

388
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:44,221
God, it's unbelievable.

389
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:45,289
I like Wynbrandt.

390
00:16:45,324 --> 00:16:47,325
He went to city college at night,

391
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,660
law school, good family man.

392
00:16:49,695 --> 00:16:51,796
Massey's our guy.

393
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,464
He clerked for Thomas, he went to Yale,

394
00:16:53,498 --> 00:16:55,733
editor of the Law Journal.

395
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,735
It's all about what's on paper for you.

396
00:16:57,769 --> 00:16:59,136
I heard Wynbrandt speak.

397
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:01,238
The man has good values.

398
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:02,807
Emily, the Governor of Michigan

399
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:05,176
is basically declaring
his state a sovereign nation,

400
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,478
so we don't have time for values.

401
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:10,681
I probably shouldn't put that
in the speech either, right?

402
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:12,450
Alex: Governor Royce said that?

403
00:17:12,484 --> 00:17:14,318
That he's the highest authority?

404
00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:17,521
That's what he said...
And in no uncertain terms.

405
00:17:17,556 --> 00:17:19,490
Then he hung the phone up on me.

406
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,768
Well, he doesn't get to do that.

407
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:22,526
He has a constitutional obligation...

408
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:23,761
Don't you get it, Alex?

409
00:17:23,795 --> 00:17:25,696
Royce wants to tear up the Constitution,

410
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:26,831
and he's not the only one.

411
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:28,199
Well, you can't let him.

412
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:29,600
Trust me, I'm not going to.

413
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:30,878
We've got some lawyers coming over

414
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:32,670
from the Attorney General's office.

415
00:17:32,704 --> 00:17:34,505
We'll figure out what
our legal options are,

416
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:36,267
and we're handle it.

417
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,379
How you holding up?

418
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:43,180
I spoke to Duncan.
The courts are closed.

419
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:46,851
Markets, banks, schools,
airports, everything.

420
00:17:46,885 --> 00:17:49,453
Half the junior associates in the firm,

421
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:51,922
they're thinking of leaving Washington.

422
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:54,692
How's Penny?

423
00:17:56,027 --> 00:17:58,496
You think she even understands
what's happening?

424
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,530
Besides the fact that

425
00:17:59,564 --> 00:18:00,865
we now live in the White House,

426
00:18:00,899 --> 00:18:02,500
her father is the President,

427
00:18:02,534 --> 00:18:05,002
and she's sleeping in a very big bed,

428
00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:06,858
no, not really.

429
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:08,806
I've been trying to
keep her away from the TV.

430
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,907
And Leo?

431
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:12,810
He's been in his room
all day, with the door shut.

432
00:18:12,844 --> 00:18:14,512
So, basically being Leo.

433
00:18:14,546 --> 00:18:17,381
Basically.

434
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:21,385
Do you think we could, for five minutes,

435
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,320
just pretend that this
isn't really happening?

436
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:29,693
Kind of hard to do in the Oval Office.

437
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:40,748
Wyatt: I'm sorry, sir.
I told him you were busy.

438
00:18:40,772 --> 00:18:41,472
It's all right.

439
00:18:41,506 --> 00:18:42,773
How can I help you, General?

440
00:18:42,808 --> 00:18:44,310
I'm afraid that's something

441
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:46,577
we have to discuss in
private, Mr. President.

442
00:18:46,611 --> 00:18:48,779
Oh. This is my wife.

443
00:18:48,814 --> 00:18:52,416
Your wife does not have
code-word clearance, sir.

444
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:54,018
Alex: Of course.

445
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:55,853
I'll go.

446
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:56,754
Ma'am.

447
00:19:00,826 --> 00:19:02,393
What is it?

448
00:19:02,427 --> 00:19:04,728
I just spoke to FBI
Deputy Director Atwood.

449
00:19:04,763 --> 00:19:06,931
The lab results came in.

450
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:10,701
They've made a
positive I.D. on the explosives.

451
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:12,933
We know who blew up the Capitol.

452
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:16,874
Al-Sakar likes
mass-causality attacks...

453
00:19:16,908 --> 00:19:18,642
A chlorine storage tank in Manila,

454
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:21,579
sarin gas tanks lobbed onto
our military base in Nairobi.

455
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:22,446
Preliminary analysis

456
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:24,715
from the FBI's Explosive Device Center

457
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:27,618
tells us that residue
found on the Capitol debris

458
00:19:27,652 --> 00:19:30,721
is consistent with bombs
used by Al-Sakar in the past.

459
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:32,923
Mr. President,

460
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,892
it's time to publicly name Al-Sakar

461
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:36,560
as the perpetrator of this crime

462
00:19:36,595 --> 00:19:38,329
- and take appropriate action.
- Tom: Okay.

463
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:39,430
Before we do anything,

464
00:19:39,464 --> 00:19:41,465
the FBI is absolutely certain

465
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,634
that Al-Sakar was behind the attack?

466
00:19:43,668 --> 00:19:45,769
75%, sir.

467
00:19:45,804 --> 00:19:46,737
75%?

468
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:49,498
That's as high as it gets when
it comes to a call like this.

469
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:53,077
75% is still a "C" on a test, General.

470
00:19:53,111 --> 00:19:54,645
This is not a test. This is war.

471
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:57,114
All the more reason to
get it right, don't you think?

472
00:19:57,148 --> 00:19:59,683
Sir, I know we got off
on the wrong foot.

473
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:02,786
You did a fine job staving
off the Iranians last night.

474
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:03,821
But I am advising you

475
00:20:03,855 --> 00:20:05,422
that the country is on the brink,

476
00:20:05,457 --> 00:20:06,790
and talk will not work here.

477
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:08,359
America is demanding action

478
00:20:08,393 --> 00:20:10,928
and I am giving you
an enemy we can kill.

479
00:20:10,962 --> 00:20:12,763
You think I don't want to strike back

480
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:14,798
against the people who did this?

481
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,834
I lost colleagues, friends,
people I love.

482
00:20:16,868 --> 00:20:18,636
I want to find every single person

483
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,838
involved in this attack
from planning to execution

484
00:20:20,872 --> 00:20:22,840
and rip them limb from limb,

485
00:20:22,874 --> 00:20:25,809
which is why I need to know
exactly who did this.

486
00:20:26,845 --> 00:20:29,013
Come back to me with more than 75%,

487
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:31,715
and I'll launch the
damn missiles myself.

488
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,199
How much more.

489
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:34,979
25%, damn it!

490
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:43,148
The death toll as of 30
minutes ago is 900 plus.

491
00:20:43,317 --> 00:20:46,810
That includes the
President, Vice President, Cabinet,

492
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:48,879
those we've been able to I.D.

493
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:51,515
from Congress and the Supreme Court...

494
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:55,018
and FBI Director Jacobs
is also confirmed dead.

495
00:20:56,754 --> 00:20:59,456
The working theory is,
this is the work of Al-Sakar.

496
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,125
So as we know, this is the
latest offshoot of Al-Qaeda.

497
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,628
They are dispersed
throughout North Africa,

498
00:21:04,662 --> 00:21:06,863
which makes them
very, very hard to track.

499
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,365
So we need to be crafty.

500
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:10,500
We need to reach out to your sources,

501
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,835
spread some cash around,

502
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:15,038
do whatever you have to
do to firm up that link.

503
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:16,840
Hannah: What about credit?

504
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:17,808
What about it?

505
00:21:17,842 --> 00:21:19,709
Is Al-Sakar taking credit?

506
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,178
No, they haven't.

507
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:23,013
But it was months before Bin Laden

508
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:26,016
took responsibility
for the Towers, so...

509
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,517
That's all for now.

510
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:28,852
Agent Wells.

511
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,330
How are you doing?

512
00:21:37,783 --> 00:21:39,678
Same as everyone else, I guess.

513
00:21:40,953 --> 00:21:43,755
I just came from Andrews.

514
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:46,357
The bomb we just found, the UXO,

515
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:48,927
it may not be telling you
what you think it is.

516
00:21:48,961 --> 00:21:50,261
Okay, I'll bite.

517
00:21:50,296 --> 00:21:52,864
All right, well, what if
they wanted us to find it

518
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:54,128
so that we would look at Al-Sakar

519
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:55,577
and not consider any other options.

520
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:57,368
Can you back up your theory?

521
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:59,404
Well, my theories
were good enough for you

522
00:21:59,438 --> 00:22:00,771
in '09 in Iraq.

523
00:22:00,772 --> 00:22:02,450
This is different,
Hannah, and you know it.

524
00:22:02,474 --> 00:22:04,375
Besides, I've already
talked to General Cochrane

525
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,710
and the Joint Chiefs.

526
00:22:05,744 --> 00:22:08,246
But you're still gonna
brief the President later, right?

527
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,049
Best to give them all the
theories, don't you think?

528
00:22:12,818 --> 00:22:14,118
So if it wasn't Al-Sakar,

529
00:22:14,153 --> 00:22:16,387
who blew up the Capitol Building?

530
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:19,290
I don't know, yet, and
that's what scares me.

531
00:22:23,362 --> 00:22:24,462
Thanks, Mike.

532
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:25,964
Okay, w-what do I do?

533
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:26,913
Am I supposed to smile

534
00:22:26,915 --> 00:22:28,310
because I'll probably feel like crying.

535
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:30,134
- Just be yourself.
- I know, I just...

536
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:31,402
I don't want to let you down.

537
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:33,605
I don't want to let the country down,

538
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:36,407
and I hate this that
they picked it out for me.

539
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:38,480
Look. I look like the White House sofa.

540
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:39,991
It's to fit over this, ma'am.

541
00:22:40,015 --> 00:22:41,646
Mike, is this all really necessary?

542
00:22:41,821 --> 00:22:43,061
Two ways the President and his family

543
00:22:43,085 --> 00:22:44,440
can leave the White House...

544
00:22:44,553 --> 00:22:46,153
Out the front door in Kevlar vests

545
00:22:46,188 --> 00:22:47,989
and a 13-car armored motorcade

546
00:22:48,023 --> 00:22:51,025
or out the back in a
Chevy and a ball cap.

547
00:22:51,927 --> 00:22:52,994
Give me the coat.

548
00:22:53,028 --> 00:22:54,195
Penny: Daddy!

549
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:56,030
Hey, little pea, how are you?

550
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,067
What are you wearing?

551
00:23:00,102 --> 00:23:01,035
Oh, this?

552
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:03,070
This is just to
protect me in case I fall down.

553
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:05,216
Cool thing is you can punch
it, and I won't feel a thing.

554
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,907
Go on, try.

555
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:10,948
Come here.

556
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,247
I love you so much.

557
00:23:16,752 --> 00:23:18,085
- It's time, sir.
- Okay.

558
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,087
H-H-Hold on. W-Where's Leo?

559
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:21,897
Relax, Mom, I'm here.

560
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:24,191
Okay, you need to watch your sister.

561
00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:26,227
And keep her away from the TV, okay?

562
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:28,029
Any of the news, it's too real.

563
00:23:28,063 --> 00:23:29,864
She doesn't need to see it.

564
00:23:29,898 --> 00:23:31,098
Have you got that?

565
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:33,601
Yeah, I understand.

566
00:23:36,104 --> 00:23:37,768
Aaron: Sir, you won't be wearing a tie.

567
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,317
It's not a formal occasion, Aaron.

568
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:41,609
Okay. Let's go.

569
00:23:41,643 --> 00:23:44,745
Mike: Phoenix is ready and on the move.

570
00:23:45,647 --> 00:23:48,315
Mike, just out of curiosity,
what was it before?

571
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,984
Sir?

572
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:52,053
My code name when I
was Secretary of HUD,

573
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:54,221
what was it?

574
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:56,290
"Glasses," sir.

575
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:08,235
We left word for the Governor
three hours ago.

576
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:11,105
Yeah, p-please tell him, again.

577
00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:13,503
Forget politics, it's just plain rude.

578
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:15,319
I mean, what the hell's
wrong with people anyway?

579
00:24:15,343 --> 00:24:17,078
People are scared, Aaron.

580
00:24:17,112 --> 00:24:19,359
The Capitol used to be
a symbol of strength,

581
00:24:19,534 --> 00:24:21,749
and now it's a pile of ashes.

582
00:24:21,783 --> 00:24:23,250
And everyone we know is gone.

583
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:25,986
You would think today, of all days,

584
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:28,322
people could at least
pretend to be decent human beings.

585
00:24:28,356 --> 00:24:30,091
Seth: Why are you so surprised?

586
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:33,160
Tragedy either makes people
appreciate their fellow men,

587
00:24:33,195 --> 00:24:35,329
or fear them.

588
00:24:35,363 --> 00:24:36,931
The Governor's no different.

589
00:24:36,965 --> 00:24:38,099
He's just elected.

590
00:24:49,244 --> 00:24:51,946
Thanks for coming with me.

591
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,914
Alex: Of course.

592
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,317
What?

593
00:24:57,546 --> 00:24:59,186
Yesterday, I was asked to resign,

594
00:24:59,221 --> 00:25:01,255
and we were talking about
moving to Montreal.

595
00:25:03,892 --> 00:25:05,159
Now I'm trying to put

596
00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:08,162
the entire U.S. government back together

597
00:25:08,196 --> 00:25:10,831
and stop the country
from tearing itself apart.

598
00:25:10,866 --> 00:25:13,000
Hell of a day.

599
00:25:15,203 --> 00:25:16,290
Yeah.

600
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,050
Man: That's the
President's motorcade coming in.

601
00:25:19,074 --> 00:25:20,374
Look out.

602
00:25:31,253 --> 00:25:33,821
Are you ready for this?

603
00:25:36,258 --> 00:25:38,893
How can anybody be ready for this?

604
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,398
Man: All right, hold the
work. Hold the work.

605
00:26:11,226 --> 00:26:12,193
My God.

606
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:22,102
Aaron: Sir.

607
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:23,904
Mr. President.

608
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,540
Tom.

609
00:26:29,477 --> 00:26:31,111
Mr. President,

610
00:26:31,146 --> 00:26:32,947
I'm Jason Atwood, Deputy Director.

611
00:26:32,981 --> 00:26:34,915
We got a briefing
ready for you inside, sir.

612
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:35,950
Okay.

613
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:40,287
Atwood: Prelim analysis from TEDAC

614
00:26:40,322 --> 00:26:43,824
indicates that the
explosive residue found on the debris

615
00:26:43,858 --> 00:26:46,493
is called cyclonite, also known as RDX.

616
00:26:46,528 --> 00:26:49,129
We believe it was mixed
with a plasticizer.

617
00:26:49,164 --> 00:26:51,254
And that's what maximizes
the destruction,

618
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:52,910
allowed the chamber
to come down on itself?

619
00:26:52,934 --> 00:26:54,969
Exactly.

620
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:56,925
And Al-Sakar has access to RDX?

621
00:26:57,054 --> 00:26:58,282
Yes, sir. It's their signature.

622
00:26:58,306 --> 00:27:01,242
What about the device
you found... the bomb?

623
00:27:01,276 --> 00:27:02,243
Why didn't it go off?

624
00:27:02,277 --> 00:27:03,510
We believe it was human error.

625
00:27:03,545 --> 00:27:05,512
We're still running some tests.

626
00:27:05,547 --> 00:27:06,340
Okay.

627
00:27:06,469 --> 00:27:08,349
Thank you, Deputy Director.

628
00:27:08,383 --> 00:27:09,917
Thank you, Mr. President.

629
00:27:09,951 --> 00:27:11,819
We'll keep you updated.

630
00:27:18,526 --> 00:27:20,406
Mike, take my coat.

631
00:27:23,527 --> 00:27:25,509
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to keep that vest on.

632
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:28,435
Mike, we're here to project confidence.

633
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,372
Does this vest project
confidence to you?

634
00:27:35,377 --> 00:27:37,077
Thank you.

635
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:40,951
- I win.
- Leo: You cheated.

636
00:27:40,985 --> 00:27:42,919
- I know your game, little girl.
- I did not.

637
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:45,689
Oh, I got to take this.

638
00:27:45,723 --> 00:27:47,190
You're supposed to watch me.

639
00:27:47,225 --> 00:27:48,625
It's the White House, Penny.

640
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:49,559
I'm sure you're safe.

641
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:00,937
Female Reporter: A truly somber moment,

642
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:02,906
as newly sworn-in President Kirkman

643
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,672
makes his first visit

644
00:28:05,673 --> 00:28:07,283
to the site of the terrorist attack.

645
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,316
We will stand by for
his comments to the nation.

646
00:28:11,015 --> 00:28:13,216
A lot of cameras, Aaron.

647
00:28:13,251 --> 00:28:14,637
You are the President, sir.

648
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,130
Excuse me. Could I borrow that?

649
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:18,789
Here you go, sir.

650
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:19,956
Thank you.

651
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:21,925
- Just press here?
- Yeah.

652
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:31,334
Hello, my name is Tom Kirkman.

653
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:34,438
Last night at approximately 10:30 p.m.,

654
00:28:34,472 --> 00:28:38,108
I was sworn in as
President of the United States.

655
00:28:38,142 --> 00:28:39,176
I've come down here

656
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,021
because I wanted to thank
each and every one of you

657
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:43,780
for the work that you're doing here

658
00:28:43,815 --> 00:28:45,949
and let you know that America mourns.

659
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:48,752
This...

660
00:28:50,388 --> 00:28:53,156
This was an act of madness.

661
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:57,160
This was an act of terror.

662
00:28:57,195 --> 00:29:01,098
Yesterday, we saw the worst in humanity.

663
00:29:01,132 --> 00:29:03,100
Today, I see it's best.

664
00:29:03,134 --> 00:29:06,036
I know you're all tired, scared.

665
00:29:06,971 --> 00:29:09,172
I know you want answers,
someone to blame,

666
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:10,774
someone to fight against.

667
00:29:10,808 --> 00:29:12,459
I need you to know that
I want that, too.

668
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,177
- Seth: What?
- And even, though, today,

669
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:16,223
It's Michigan.

670
00:29:16,247 --> 00:29:18,715
...I promise you we will rise again

671
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:20,060
better and stronger.

672
00:29:20,084 --> 00:29:21,885
Man: Get down!

673
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,053
Those who we've lost...

674
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:28,135
Are leaders, family members...

675
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,993
...and loved ones.

676
00:29:30,027 --> 00:29:32,996
I swear to you, they
will not have died in vain.

677
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,065
Hey, you see what's
going on in Michigan.

678
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:37,044
This place where we stand
right here, right now...

679
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:38,735
Man: Let's get him out of here!

680
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:41,245
Tom: ...will forever be hallowed ground,

681
00:29:41,374 --> 00:29:44,407
and we must always...

682
00:29:44,442 --> 00:29:47,310
...respect the incredible sacrifice

683
00:29:47,345 --> 00:29:48,378
that was made here.

684
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,890
Reporter: Mr. President,
do you have anything to say

685
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,191
about the Muslim teenager in Dearborn

686
00:29:51,215 --> 00:29:52,315
who was beaten by police?

687
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,194
The President's not
answering any questions right now.

688
00:29:54,218 --> 00:29:56,096
- Thank you.
- You have no response, President Kirkman?

689
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,889
- I-I didn't hear the question.
- The Muslim teenager

690
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:00,100
who was beaten by police, Mr. President.

691
00:30:00,124 --> 00:30:01,082
- Do you have a comment?
- What?

692
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,036
Are you concerned that their civil
rights are being violated?

693
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,238
Reporter: Is the White House concerned

694
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:05,929
about escalating violence
against Muslims?

695
00:30:05,963 --> 00:30:07,407
Are you gonna let Americans
get beaten, Mr. Kirkman.

696
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,243
- Man: Show me your hands!
- Sir, I need you to step back.

697
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:11,245
Don't touch me.

698
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:12,469
Gun! Gun! Gun!

699
00:30:17,121 --> 00:30:18,608
Mike: Cover and evacuate to the car.

700
00:30:19,124 --> 00:30:21,350
Man: Get your hands off him.
He's not doing anything.

701
00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:23,246
It's a phone. It's a phone!

702
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:25,248
I have Phoenix! I repeat,
I have Phoenix!

703
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:27,083
Man: Back up! Back up!

704
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:28,351
I said back up!

705
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,091
Go, go, go!

706
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,309
Get me Governor Royce on the phone now.

707
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,351
We've been trying.
He won't take the call.

708
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,486
What do you mean he won't take the call?

709
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,254
Do we know anything about
the condition of the boy,

710
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:52,155
the one in the Michigan?

711
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:54,347
He's in surgery with internal bleeding.

712
00:30:54,381 --> 00:30:55,492
He knows we're
calling, sir. He doesn't care.

713
00:30:55,516 --> 00:30:56,983
I want to talk to a couple lawyers

714
00:30:57,017 --> 00:30:58,193
from the Attorney General's Office.

715
00:30:58,195 --> 00:31:00,653
- What's his name? How old is he?
- Danny Fayad, ma'am.

716
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:02,365
We have a couple A.G. candidates
who could be helpful.

717
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:03,409
Bring them in.

718
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,467
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

719
00:31:04,491 --> 00:31:06,426
- Your daughter needs you upstairs.
- Okay.

720
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:10,530
Tom, the boy... he's 17...

721
00:31:10,564 --> 00:31:11,597
The same age as Leo.

722
00:31:11,632 --> 00:31:14,333
Penny needs me. I got to go.

723
00:31:17,371 --> 00:31:20,173
Jason: I don't have to explain
myself to you Hannah.

724
00:31:20,207 --> 00:31:22,341
I gave the President what I determined

725
00:31:22,376 --> 00:31:23,709
was the most relevant intel.

726
00:31:23,744 --> 00:31:25,455
Or you gave him what
the group who did this

727
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:26,512
wanted you to give him.

728
00:31:26,547 --> 00:31:28,458
How can he lead if he doesn't
have all the facts?

729
00:31:28,482 --> 00:31:30,149
Then you should have given them to me.

730
00:31:31,084 --> 00:31:33,386
Look, it's not...

731
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,521
that I don't belive you,
or that I don't want to.

732
00:31:35,556 --> 00:31:38,691
Someone blew up the Capitol.

733
00:31:38,725 --> 00:31:40,393
Who knows what's possible anymore.

734
00:31:40,427 --> 00:31:43,396
On top of that, we got a guy in office

735
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,565
who's number 11 in
the line of succession.

736
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:47,377
I can't go to him with
speculation right now.

737
00:31:47,401 --> 00:31:48,835
So, if you want me

738
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:51,571
to go back to him with your theory,

739
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:53,473
please prove it.

740
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,544
Tom: The situation in Michigan
is out of control.

741
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:00,813
Now we've got a teenager
in critical condition.

742
00:32:00,848 --> 00:32:03,249
I need to know what my
legal options are right now.

743
00:32:03,283 --> 00:32:05,218
Well, uh, Mr. President.

744
00:32:05,252 --> 00:32:07,353
You can invoke the Supremacy Clause,

745
00:32:07,387 --> 00:32:08,521
issue an executive order

746
00:32:08,555 --> 00:32:11,357
saying Governor Royce must force
his police to stand down.

747
00:32:11,391 --> 00:32:12,725
Wynbrandt: That's a bad call.

748
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:14,694
E.O.s can be perceived as very hostile.

749
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:16,395
Then what would you suggest?

750
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,474
A Presidential Proclamation.

751
00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:20,066
Which is nothing more than
a symbolic empty gesture.

752
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,734
It... it looks weak, sir.

753
00:32:21,768 --> 00:32:23,269
Bush used a Proclamation

754
00:32:23,303 --> 00:32:25,271
to secure disaster areas after Katrina.

755
00:32:25,305 --> 00:32:27,440
That hardly seems like
an empty gesture to me.

756
00:32:27,474 --> 00:32:29,275
I wouldn't take declaring Martial Law

757
00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:30,386
- off the table either, sir.
- If you want this to be

758
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:33,412
the shortest presidency in history.

759
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:35,414
Let me get this straight.

760
00:32:35,449 --> 00:32:39,418
An executive order will be
perceived as too hostile,

761
00:32:39,453 --> 00:32:41,387
A Presidential Proclamation... Too weak.

762
00:32:41,421 --> 00:32:42,522
Martial Law...

763
00:32:42,556 --> 00:32:44,390
Either very, very smart

764
00:32:44,424 --> 00:32:46,125
or incredibly self-destructive.

765
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,761
Guys, let me ask you a question.

766
00:32:48,795 --> 00:32:50,196
Can you agree on anything?

767
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,098
- Yes.
- Not really.

768
00:32:52,566 --> 00:32:53,566
Great.

769
00:32:57,094 --> 00:32:58,437
How is she?

770
00:32:58,472 --> 00:33:00,606
Well, how do you think she is?

771
00:33:00,641 --> 00:33:03,376
She just watched her father
almost get trampled.

772
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,835
You had one job...

773
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,479
- to keep her away from the TV.
- I did.

774
00:33:06,513 --> 00:33:07,914
Until you didn't.

775
00:33:07,948 --> 00:33:09,448
Y-You left her alone.

776
00:33:09,483 --> 00:33:10,883
I got a phone call.

777
00:33:10,918 --> 00:33:13,886
It... it's not my job to be her parent.

778
00:33:15,455 --> 00:33:16,289
Well, guess what.

779
00:33:16,323 --> 00:33:17,100
We're all doing jobs

780
00:33:17,124 --> 00:33:18,758
that we weren't doing yesterday.

781
00:33:20,594 --> 00:33:25,431
Leo, nothing's the same anymore.

782
00:33:25,465 --> 00:33:28,601
Look, I know it's asking a lot.

783
00:33:28,635 --> 00:33:32,104
But you're just gonna
have to grow up faster.

784
00:33:32,673 --> 00:33:34,507
I-I'm gonna need to count on you

785
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:36,275
in more ways than ever.

786
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,777
Can I do that?

787
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:40,613
Can I do that?

788
00:33:41,381 --> 00:33:42,882
Guess we'll find out.

789
00:33:47,321 --> 00:33:48,387
Take these to Treasury.

790
00:33:48,422 --> 00:33:50,433
Tell them Social Security
checks will keep going out,

791
00:33:50,457 --> 00:33:52,330
- if I have to sign them myself.
- Yes, sir.

792
00:33:53,327 --> 00:33:55,928
Aaron, I thought we were in agreement.

793
00:33:55,963 --> 00:33:57,930
Really, General?

794
00:33:57,965 --> 00:33:59,365
About what?

795
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:01,667
He's in over his head, out of his depth.

796
00:34:01,702 --> 00:34:03,536
You need to convince your new boss

797
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,304
that Al-Sakar is behind the bombing.

798
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:06,839
I think he was pretty clear in there.

799
00:34:06,873 --> 00:34:09,542
Until he's certain,
he will not name anyone.

800
00:34:09,576 --> 00:34:12,178
And as I recall, it's
your job to convince him.

801
00:34:12,212 --> 00:34:14,814
- Aaron, you're Chief of Staff.
- Actually, I'm not.

802
00:34:14,848 --> 00:34:18,351
- So, who is?
- He hasn't named one, yet.

803
00:34:18,385 --> 00:34:20,486
And yet another trigger he won't pull.

804
00:34:27,327 --> 00:34:29,528
Hi.

805
00:34:29,563 --> 00:34:32,665
Mm. Light reading?

806
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:34,567
Well, sadly, it seems that Wikipedia

807
00:34:34,601 --> 00:34:39,205
is a little thin on
constitutional-law theory.

808
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,223
Well, did the lawyers

809
00:34:40,224 --> 00:34:41,718
not give you any answers about Michigan.

810
00:34:41,742 --> 00:34:43,476
They gave me plenty of answers.

811
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,910
They just weren't the right ones.

812
00:34:44,945 --> 00:34:46,412
It doesn't even matter, yet.

813
00:34:46,446 --> 00:34:48,381
I can't get Governor Royce
back on the phone.

814
00:34:48,415 --> 00:34:51,550
Well, maybe it's time to force his hand.

815
00:34:51,585 --> 00:34:53,586
What do you mean?

816
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,620
When George Wallace

817
00:34:54,655 --> 00:34:58,491
refused an order to integrate
schools in Alabama,

818
00:34:58,525 --> 00:35:01,694
J.F.K. had his brother
federalize the National Guard

819
00:35:01,728 --> 00:35:03,729
and forced him to obey the law.

820
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,433
"Federalize the National Guard."

821
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:10,569
Well, it's brilliant,
but it's also a little...

822
00:35:10,604 --> 00:35:11,570
Nuclear.

823
00:35:11,605 --> 00:35:12,905
Yeah.

824
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:13,973
Hey.

825
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,010
I don't need a nuclear solution.

826
00:35:18,045 --> 00:35:19,712
I need a political one.

827
00:35:21,615 --> 00:35:25,017
Good thing we have a
politician in the family.

828
00:35:25,052 --> 00:35:26,578
We'll see about that.

829
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:29,388
Man: Mr. President,
your call's on line 1.

830
00:35:32,626 --> 00:35:33,893
Yeah.

831
00:35:38,765 --> 00:35:40,499
Okay, thank you very much.

832
00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:43,936
Alex: Tom?

833
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,573
- The boy from Michigan.
- Danny Fayad.

834
00:35:50,343 --> 00:35:51,857
He just died.

835
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,544
Emily: Mr. President.

836
00:35:57,095 --> 00:35:59,030
- Tell me you got him.
- Yes.

837
00:35:59,064 --> 00:36:01,132
Governor Royce and
Congresswoman Hookstraten

838
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:02,006
are both on the board

839
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,916
of the American Enterprise Institute.

840
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:05,480
If anyone can get him
back to the table...

841
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,193
That was smart. Good job.

842
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,016
Okay, Mr. President.

843
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,774
He's coming back on the line now.

844
00:36:09,808 --> 00:36:11,943
- Thank you.
- My pleasure, sir.

845
00:36:14,613 --> 00:36:16,113
Tom: Governor Royce.

846
00:36:16,148 --> 00:36:17,582
You're a hard man to reach.

847
00:36:17,616 --> 00:36:19,417
Well, I told you before.
I'm pretty busy.

848
00:36:19,451 --> 00:36:21,953
Well, we're gonna try
and lighten the load for you,

849
00:36:21,987 --> 00:36:23,020
For the record,

850
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,256
I am ordering you to
have your police stand down

851
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,853
and stop harassing the Muslim
community in Dearborn.

852
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:28,837
I also need you to release

853
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:30,305
everybody that you've picked up today

854
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:32,597
that you have not formally
charged with a crime.

855
00:36:32,631 --> 00:36:33,978
Look, I told you before,

856
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:36,067
my police are doing what they have to do

857
00:36:36,101 --> 00:36:37,301
to protect my citizens.

858
00:36:37,336 --> 00:36:39,280
With all due respect, Governor,
they're not your citizens.

859
00:36:39,304 --> 00:36:41,973
They're mine, and it's
my job to protect them.

860
00:36:42,007 --> 00:36:44,075
It's a job you have no business doing.

861
00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:46,143
Well, not according to the Constitution.

862
00:36:46,178 --> 00:36:47,550
Governor, you should also know

863
00:36:47,551 --> 00:36:49,369
that your police unknowingly picked up

864
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,282
three undercover operatives

865
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:53,317
working on a long lead investigation

866
00:36:53,352 --> 00:36:54,385
for Homeland Security.

867
00:36:54,419 --> 00:36:57,021
I can't give you their names
because it's classified,

868
00:36:57,055 --> 00:36:59,023
and you don't have clearance.

869
00:36:59,057 --> 00:37:00,368
That is why I need you to release

870
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:02,510
everybody that you've picked up today.

871
00:37:02,661 --> 00:37:04,172
Well... I'm not gonna do that.

872
00:37:04,196 --> 00:37:05,162
Well, then, Governor,

873
00:37:05,197 --> 00:37:07,131
you'll be obstructing
a federal investigation.

874
00:37:07,165 --> 00:37:10,067
I'm sure you're aware of
the consequences for that.

875
00:37:15,007 --> 00:37:16,767
Look, I'm just trying
to keep my people safe.

876
00:37:17,876 --> 00:37:20,111
How safe is Danny Fayad this evening?

877
00:37:25,384 --> 00:37:27,318
Governor, I need your answer now.

878
00:37:29,221 --> 00:37:31,856
I'll call the State Police,

879
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:33,057
tell them to stand down

880
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:34,859
and release everyone we've picked up.

881
00:37:34,893 --> 00:37:35,893
Thank you.

882
00:37:38,664 --> 00:37:39,630
Aaron: Mr. President,

883
00:37:39,665 --> 00:37:41,532
would you like me to contact
Homeland Security,

884
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:44,835
tell them their agents
have been released?

885
00:37:47,205 --> 00:37:48,372
There were no agents.

886
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:51,075
It was a bluff.

887
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:54,245
A band-aid to stop the
bleeding for now.

888
00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:55,413
Well done, Mr. President.

889
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:57,882
Governor Royce is a good man.

890
00:37:57,916 --> 00:38:00,217
He was just wrong today.

891
00:38:00,252 --> 00:38:02,887
- Thank you for your help, Kimble.
- Sir.

892
00:38:02,921 --> 00:38:04,322
Thank you, everyone.

893
00:38:04,356 --> 00:38:05,623
Great work.

894
00:38:08,193 --> 00:38:10,227
Seth, can you hold up for a minute?

895
00:38:12,564 --> 00:38:14,899
Walk with me.

896
00:38:16,368 --> 00:38:20,605
D.C. police called the
White House switchboard,

897
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:22,974
wanted to confirm that you worked here.

898
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,977
What happened this morning?

899
00:38:27,746 --> 00:38:29,113
What happened in Michigan.

900
00:38:29,147 --> 00:38:30,314
What always happens.

901
00:38:31,149 --> 00:38:33,084
When people don't know
who their enemy is,

902
00:38:33,118 --> 00:38:35,052
they start with people who look like me.

903
00:38:39,224 --> 00:38:40,958
They want me to name Al-Sakar

904
00:38:40,993 --> 00:38:44,729
as the group behind the bombing.

905
00:38:44,763 --> 00:38:48,432
But the FBI can't confirm
with absolute certainty

906
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:50,101
that they did it.

907
00:38:50,135 --> 00:38:53,738
So, I can't do anything.

908
00:38:53,772 --> 00:38:57,742
Otherwise, I'd be just as
bad as Governor Royce.

909
00:38:57,776 --> 00:38:59,477
We got to get this right.

910
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:01,245
We will, sir.

911
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,582
- How are you getting home?
- Sorry.

912
00:39:04,616 --> 00:39:05,983
How are you getting home?

913
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:07,985
I can have the Secret Service drive you.

914
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,287
Oh, no. That won't be necessary.

915
00:39:10,322 --> 00:39:12,089
Thank you, Mr. President. I'll be fine.

916
00:39:12,124 --> 00:39:13,924
Be careful, Seth.

917
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,160
Thank you, sir.

918
00:39:16,194 --> 00:39:17,928
Good night.

919
00:39:19,164 --> 00:39:20,431
Wyatt!

920
00:39:20,465 --> 00:39:21,565
Wyatt: Yes, sir.

921
00:39:23,669 --> 00:39:27,104
Could I please have the number
for Danny Fayad's parents?

922
00:39:52,664 --> 00:39:57,168
I need you to know that
words could never express

923
00:39:57,202 --> 00:39:59,336
how sorry I am for your loss.

924
00:40:04,543 --> 00:40:05,609
Yes, sir.

925
00:40:05,644 --> 00:40:07,311
Goodnight.

926
00:40:24,663 --> 00:40:26,197
Hey, Mike.

927
00:40:28,734 --> 00:40:30,468
You wouldn't happen
to have a baseball cap

928
00:40:30,502 --> 00:40:32,069
laying around, would you?

929
00:40:32,104 --> 00:40:34,271
Yes, sir.

930
00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:52,056
You lose someone?

931
00:40:56,428 --> 00:40:59,196
Yeah.

932
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:02,266
I lost everyone.

933
00:41:06,872 --> 00:41:08,239
Thank you.

934
00:41:23,388 --> 00:41:26,423
Thank you.

935
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:29,360
Thank you for your service.

936
00:41:31,296 --> 00:41:32,897
Thank you for your service.

937
00:41:32,931 --> 00:41:35,266
Thank you, Mr. President.

938
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,333
Thank you.

939
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:55,452
Thanks for bringing me here, Mike.

940
00:41:55,487 --> 00:41:57,388
It's an honor, sir.

941
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:43,167
Man: Hey, over here! We found one!

942
00:42:43,201 --> 00:42:44,635
We got a survivor!

943
00:42:44,669 --> 00:42:46,737
We got a survivor over here!

944
00:42:46,837 --> 00:42:52,506
