00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,732
There are times when we make history,

5
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:39,069
and there are times
when history makes us.

6
00:00:39,104 --> 00:00:41,639
This is a crucial moment for our nation,

7
00:00:41,673 --> 00:00:44,074
and America's colors burn brightest
colors: 성조기

8
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:46,477
when we meet challenges head on.

9
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:48,245
For far too long,

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,750
the wealthiest 1% have
seen their fortunes only grow

11
00:00:52,784 --> 00:00:54,652
while the rest of
the nation lies in worry.

12
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:57,488
That needs to change.

13
00:00:57,522 --> 00:01:00,658
The question is, how do we pay for it?

14
00:01:00,692 --> 00:01:03,527
But the question is,
how do we pay for it?

15
00:01:03,562 --> 00:01:06,330
It's not even in the
vicinity of what we agreed on.
vicinity:근처,비슷한것

16
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:08,532
No! This is not a quid pro quo.
quid pro quo : 대가, 보상 (Latin, "what for what")

17
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:11,035
This is "You do what I say when I say it

18
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:13,204
or you suffer the consequences."

19
00:01:13,238 --> 00:01:15,105
Uh, it's beyond bedti...

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,508
Penny, y-you need to
go to sleep right now.

21
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:19,176
Let me talk to her.

22
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:22,446
No, you can't talk to Dad.

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,814
Let me talk to her. Come on.

24
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:25,716
And not just here at home...

25
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,618
Hello?

26
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:28,619
Hi, Daddy.

27
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:29,620
Who is this?

28
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:30,788
It's Penny.

29
00:01:30,822 --> 00:01:32,122
Penny who?

30
00:01:32,157 --> 00:01:34,191
Penny Kirkman, your daughter.

31
00:01:34,226 --> 00:01:35,526
No, that's not possible.

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,704
My daughter's asleep, and I know that

33
00:01:36,728 --> 00:01:40,564
because I kissed her good
night almost two hours ago.

34
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,533
When are you and Mommy coming home?

35
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:45,669
It doesn't matter. You're gonna
be asleep by then, right?

36
00:01:45,704 --> 00:01:47,037
Right?

37
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,140
She can't keep pulling this.

38
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:51,163
I've got an idea.

39
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:52,820
What if you go to bed right now

40
00:01:52,844 --> 00:01:55,646
and I let you stay up an
extra hour tomorrow night

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,847
so we can hang out?

42
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:58,849
- Sound like a deal?
- Deal.

43
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:00,050
That's my girl.

44
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:01,051
Give me a kiss.

45
00:02:03,288 --> 00:02:04,388
Good night, Daddy.

46
00:02:04,422 --> 00:02:06,190
Good night, little pea.

47
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:07,658
See? All good.

48
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:09,693
Not all good.

49
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:10,838
What do you mean, not all good?

50
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:13,831
Tom, you can't do that.

51
00:02:13,865 --> 00:02:16,166
You can't make promises that
you won't be able to keep.

52
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:17,234
We're in Washington.

53
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:19,169
They're the only promises
we're allowed to make.

54
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:25,175
You know, you need to learn
how to set some limits with her.

55
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,280
Because if not, she is
gonna walk all over you.
walk all over : 말을 안듣다

56
00:02:29,314 --> 00:02:30,581
I know.

57
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:31,982
You're right.

58
00:02:32,017 --> 00:02:37,388
...values that we hold
dear, that represent who we are...
hold dear : 가치있게 여기다

Here come the greatest hits.
greatest hits : best of album

60
00:02:39,457 --> 00:02:41,692
...to ensure you that
the same American dream

61
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:44,762
shared by our fathers, our mothers,

62
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:46,597
and their fathers and...

63
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:50,601
That's weird.
이상하네

64
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:56,751
- What is it?
- It won't come back on.

65
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:58,219
See if you can get it to work.

66
00:02:58,243 --> 00:02:59,443
Okay.

67
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:00,711
Yeah.

68
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:03,213
No, I know. Ours just went black, too.

69
00:03:03,248 --> 00:03:05,282
Tom!

70
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:07,284
- Oh, my God!
- I'll get back to you.

71
00:03:08,253 --> 00:03:09,497
Mr. Secretary, you
need to put the phone down.
Secretary:장관

72
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,465
- Mike, what the hell is going on?
- I said put the phone down.

73
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:12,300
- Okay, okay.
- Ma'am, your phone.

74
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:13,301
We've lost contact with the Capitol.

75
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:14,895
We're sheltering in place
until we know more.

76
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:16,357
I need your government-issued BlackBerry.

77
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,886
What?

78
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:18,472
Do you have any other devices on you?

79
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:20,297
- Uh...
- Please, check your bag, ma'am.

80
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:21,598
But I... But I... I need...

81
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:24,168
We are getting reports

82
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:27,671
of some kind of explosion in
or around the Capitol building.

83
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:29,173
We are still...

84
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:43,187
Mr. Secretary, get
away from the window, now!

85
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:45,155
Oh, my God.

86
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,661
Oh.

I thought you said you were
gonna get some sleep.

00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:14,218
I'm okay.

91
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:16,954
National Sleep Foundation
recommends seven hours

92
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:19,289
to function as a normal human being.

93
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:21,859
A working mother only needs four.

94
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:24,194
Uh, correction... Only gets four.

95
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,533
Hey.

96
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:36,573
No. No.

97
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:37,918
- I'm not doing anything.
- Tom, I have...

98
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:39,743
No. Stop it. I have work to do.

99
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:40,855
So do I, and it's a two-person job.

100
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,947
Come on. You've always said
you're always on my side.

101
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:46,417
Mm. Yes.

102
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:48,619
That's all I want.

103
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:54,258
- Mom!
- No, no, no, no.

104
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:55,592
Go away!

105
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:57,561
Dad! Get out here!

106
00:04:57,595 --> 00:04:58,706
I'm hungry! I want some breakfast!

107
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,731
Leave us alone! You are not loved!

108
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:04,334
Please!

109
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:07,738
- No.
- Are you kidding?

110
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:09,740
Okay. You're gonna get what you deserve.

111
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:11,575
- I'm making breakfast.
- No. No, no, no.

112
00:05:11,609 --> 00:05:12,887
- Pancakes for everyone!
- Please, no!

113
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:14,344
Let me go, woman!

114
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:15,946
Oh, God.

115
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,015
Okay, little pea. How
do you like your eggs?

116
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:19,716
Scrambled or scrambled?

117
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:21,785
Um, scrambled, please.

118
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,886
Excellent.

119
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:24,721
Scrambled eggs coming up

120
00:05:24,756 --> 00:05:28,025
for the beautiful girl
sitting at the counter.

121
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:31,462
And there we go.

122
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:32,596
Thank you.

123
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,764
You're welcome.

124
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:35,599
Leo. Perfect timing. What do you want?

125
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:37,034
Uh...

126
00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:38,402
He's making breakfast?

127
00:05:38,436 --> 00:05:39,470
Unfortunately.

128
00:05:39,504 --> 00:05:41,438
Hey, I'm slaving over here.

129
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:42,806
I'll just get some toast.

130
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:43,807
Toast, toast.

131
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:45,815
That's made with bread, right?

132
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:48,622
Come on. You used to
always laugh at my jokes.

133
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:49,913
I used to be nine.

134
00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:50,981
Ah, the good ol' days.

135
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:52,960
Hey, I need you to watch
your sister tonight, okay?

136
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:54,284
Uh, no. I can't do it. I'm busy.

137
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,619
I know... Watching your sister.

138
00:05:55,653 --> 00:05:56,430
Come on. It's a big night for me.

139
00:05:56,454 --> 00:05:57,821
I've got the State of the Union.
State of the Union: 연두교서.

140
00:05:57,856 --> 00:05:58,822
Well, it is for me, too.

141
00:05:58,857 --> 00:06:00,624
I told Caleb I'd help
him out with something.

142
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:02,726
- With what?
- It doesn't matter.

143
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,104
It doesn't matter
because I won't like it

144
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:06,763
or doesn't matter 'cause
I won't understand?

145
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:07,798
Both.

146
00:06:07,832 --> 00:06:10,434
Okay, now I really want to know.

147
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:12,569
He's laying down a new dubstep track,

148
00:06:12,604 --> 00:06:14,124
and I need to write a program for him.

149
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:18,008
I understood "him."

150
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:20,077
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how much do I embarrass you?

151
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:22,646
- 11.
- Excellent.

152
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,648
Hey, you finish your English paper yet?

153
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:26,583
- Uh, in theory.
- Finish it.

154
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:30,487
You can take them, right? I
have to be at court by 9:00.

155
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:31,989
Yeah, I got them.

156
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:33,924
Bye, peanut.

157
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,125
Bye, Mommy.

158
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,460
Make us proud.

159
00:06:38,863 --> 00:06:41,498
...immigration reform, but
the sad truth of the matter

160
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:43,834
is that Richmond can promise
all he wants tonight...

161
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:46,970
This Congress isn't gonna
lift a finger to help him.

162
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,518
Well, this can't be good
if it won't even wait

163
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:51,675
till I get to the office.

164
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:52,976
How about the end of days?

165
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:54,688
I just spoke to Gillings
at Cabinet Affairs.

166
00:06:54,712 --> 00:06:56,557
He slipped me a final copy
of Richmond's address

167
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:59,021
and none, not a single one of
our talking points are included.

168
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,117
You're kidding me.

169
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:01,518
Not even housing reform?

170
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:03,487
All of it, everything you and I have

171
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:05,473
worked our asses
off on for months, gone.

172
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:06,124
Okay, okay.

173
00:07:06,157 --> 00:07:08,002
Just get me a meeting with
Langdon as soon as possible.

174
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:09,860
Already done. We're going there now.

175
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:10,994
It's time to war up.

176
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:12,696
Easy, Hannibal.

177
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,965
We should also talk about
leaking your plan to Politico

178
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:17,167
- if this doesn't work.
- No, that'll backfire.

179
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:18,635
Maybe, but it'll be out there.

180
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,147
Tonight is about what's in
the State of the Union,

181
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:21,204
not what's not.

182
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:23,373
We can't just let the White
House take an eraser

183
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:24,875
to our entire domestic agenda.

184
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:27,077
You're the Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development.

185
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:29,646
It's the President's
domestic agenda, Em.

186
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:31,715
It's your domestic agenda,
Mr. Secretary.

187
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:33,093
Okay, and I'll make my argument for it.

188
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:34,094
Look, don't get me wrong.

189
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:35,763
I'm as mad as hell.
But at the end of the day,

190
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:37,588
I'm not the President
of the United States.

191
00:07:37,622 --> 00:07:39,923
We should remember that.

192
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,726
All right. Then let's
go see the Chief of Staff.

193
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:44,805
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, sir.

194
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:46,574
We need to tell the
American people how we're doing,

195
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:47,708
and we need to get specific.

196
00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:49,043
Could one of you please
find me something heavy

197
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,667
to hit Mr. Wright with? Thank you.

198
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:52,613
I'm telling you. We need to take
a look at the AB-33 section,

199
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:53,614
okay? The message is muddled.

200
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:54,682
I wrote it, and I
don't even know what it says.

201
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:57,708
That is the mark of a
successful political speech.

202
00:07:57,742 --> 00:08:00,043
Well done. Now, go forth.

203
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:02,746
- Mr. Secretary, welcome. Please.
- Charlie.

204
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,215
I'm sure you remember Aaron
Shore, my Deputy Chief of Staff.

205
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:07,084
- Aaron, good to see you.
- Mr. Secretary.

206
00:08:07,118 --> 00:08:08,929
I'm gonna hazard a guess
and say you're not here

207
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:11,888
to discuss which color tie the
President is wearing tonight.

208
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:13,924
That is his call...

209
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,627
if he'll put back in the
Secretary's housing initiatives.

210
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:19,763
These are programs that can help
millions of low-income families.

211
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:21,565
No one's debating its value here, Emily.

212
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,134
Charlie, there's not a single mention

213
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:25,969
of any of my programs
in the speech tonight?

214
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:28,538
- Not a one?
- I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Secretary,

215
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:29,950
but that's how it's
gonna be. The speech is locked.

216
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:32,576
Does the President value the
Secretary's opinion, Charlie?

217
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,954
Because right now, it's hard to tell.

218
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:35,612
Em.

219
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:37,848
Give us a moment.

220
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:41,852
I'll meet you outside.

221
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,094
What's going on, Charlie?

222
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:52,796
Well, Tom, we were gonna wait till after

223
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,174
the State of the Union to tell you this,

224
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:56,633
but the President's looking
to make a change.

225
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:58,802
He would like to
offer you an ambassadorship

226
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:00,971
to the International
Civil Aviation Organization.

227
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:03,240
Are you serious?

228
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:06,276
Was the Chairman of the
International House of Pancakes unavailable?

229
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,577
Tom...

230
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:12,182
Wow.

231
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:16,119
This is really not
how I saw today going.

232
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:22,192
Uh...

233
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:24,027
The Civil Aviation Committee...

234
00:09:24,062 --> 00:09:25,696
- Organization.
- Organization.

235
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,197
Is that even a real thing, Charlie?

236
00:09:27,231 --> 00:09:28,832
Of course it's a thing.

237
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:30,600
It's in Montreal. It's under the U.N.

238
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:32,279
Look, it affords you
the rank of ambassador

239
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:33,947
with all the trimmings
that go along with it.

240
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:36,940
Come on, Charlie. We've
done some good work here.

241
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:39,843
And we've got lots left to do, I mean...

242
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:41,144
I have supported this president

243
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:43,113
above and beyond for his entire term.

244
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:45,148
Well, now it's about the second term.

245
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:47,517
And I serve at the pleasure
of the President.

246
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:49,152
So do you, Tom.

247
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:55,559
Don't they realize what a
huge asset you are for them?

248
00:09:55,593 --> 00:09:57,728
Langdon actually tried to
pass it off as a promotion.

249
00:09:57,762 --> 00:09:59,629
Uh, you can't take this lying down.

250
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:01,665
- How else do you want me to take it?
- Fight.

251
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:04,568
Look, he appointed you,
but he can't fire you.

252
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:05,802
You need to hold your ground.

253
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:07,170
What do you want me to do?

254
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:09,740
Go to war with the President
of the United States?

255
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:11,308
The White House never respected you.

256
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:12,976
That's the real problem.

257
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,154
No, Alex. The real problem is

258
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:15,856
I didn't play
Richmond's game all the time.

259
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,047
Oh, Tom, come on!

260
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:18,882
It's called politics.

261
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,917
- And maybe if you did...
- What?

262
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:22,652
I wouldn't be out of a job?

263
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:24,331
Maybe, but then I'd be
just like one of those guys,

264
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:26,089
and when I got into this, we had a deal.

265
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:27,234
I wasn't gonna be one of those guys.

266
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:30,594
- I don't want to be...
- Tom, it's taken three years.

267
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:34,664
And we finally settled into Washington.

268
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:36,900
I love my job.

269
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:38,735
Penny loves her school.

270
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,070
Even Leo's making friends.

271
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:42,572
We can't do this to our family.

272
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,909
I know.

273
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,814
You're right.

274
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:55,919
Come here. Come here.

275
00:10:55,953 --> 00:10:57,788
Hey.

276
00:10:57,822 --> 00:11:01,124
I love you.

277
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,926
We'll make this work.

278
00:11:06,097 --> 00:11:07,230
I'll commute.

279
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:08,698
What?

280
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:10,934
So, you've made up your mind?

281
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:12,302
You're stepping down?

282
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:14,704
I told them I'd give them
my decision tomorrow.

283
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:18,608
Wow.

284
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:19,876
Alex.

285
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,050
Great.

286
00:11:27,084 --> 00:11:29,085
Yeah?

287
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:33,290
What's a designated survivor?

288
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:35,826
Mr. Secretary, we need to leave now.

289
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,927
- Tom!
- Did you see that?

290
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:38,359
- Tom!
- Did you see that?

291
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,439
...motorcade to smoke out any ambush.

292
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:40,997
White House is secure. Let's go.

293
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,998
Mike, please, just
tell us what you know.

294
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:17,868
Capitol's been attacked.

295
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:20,871
There's still no word on
the President or his detail.

296
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:24,274
This is Ritter.

297
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,014
Oh, God. Don't tell me that.

298
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:33,350
What is it?

299
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:36,119
It's confirmed.

300
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:37,988
Eagle is gone.

301
00:12:38,022 --> 00:12:40,457
- Congress, the Cabinet.
- Oh, oh, my God.

302
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:42,492
None of them made it.

303
00:12:42,526 --> 00:12:45,061
Yes, sir.

304
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:47,330
I'll let him know.

305
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,302
Mr. Secretary, we're enacting
continuity of government.

306
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:55,305
A D.C. appellate judge
will meet us at the White House.

307
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:59,476
Sir, you are now the President
of the United States.

308
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:08,290
Incredibly alarming live shot.

309
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:10,281
The United States
Capitol Building in flames.

310
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:13,674
An explosion... should I say
an unconfirmed explosion...

311
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,676
Going off just moments ago

312
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,722
during President
Richmond's State of the Union address.

313
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:19,390
Of course, we're reaching out

314
00:13:19,414 --> 00:13:20,859
to all of our sources...

315
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,984
Pick up. Come on.

316
00:13:23,018 --> 00:13:25,620
Hi. This is Scott. I'm
not available right now.

317
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:27,355
Please leave me a message
after the beep.

318
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,690
Hey, it's me.

319
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,692
Call me when you get this.

320
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,861
I need to know you're okay.

321
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:38,399
Hey, Scott?

322
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:40,334
No, it's Doug. I
need you here right away.

323
00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:42,570
Yes, sir. I'm on my way.

324
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:10,898
Ma'am...

325
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:11,943
We got to get our kids here.

326
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,035
We've already sent agents
to bring them here.

327
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:29,383
We are still working to
get all the information

328
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:31,986
of exactly what happened...

329
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:39,060
Sir, please.

330
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:40,828
Sir, please.

331
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,031
Ma'am, please hold the Bible.

332
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:46,300
Just hold the Bible. Thank you.

333
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:49,604
Sir, place your left hand on
the Bible and repeat after me.

334
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,440
"I, Thomas Adam Kirkman,
do solemnly swear..."

335
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,309
I, Thomas Adam Kirkman,
do solemnly swear...

336
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:57,088
"...that I will faithfully
execute the office

337
00:14:57,112 --> 00:14:58,946
of President of the United States..."

338
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,882
...that I will faithfully
execute the office

339
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,293
of President of the United States...

340
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:04,552
"...and will, to
the best of my ability..."

341
00:15:04,586 --> 00:15:07,088
...and will, to the
best of my ability...

342
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:09,290
"...preserve, protect, and defend

343
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:11,392
the Constitution of the United States."

344
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:12,960
...preserve, protect, and defend

345
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,062
the Constitution of the United States,

346
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:16,764
so help me God.

347
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:18,733
Mr. President.

348
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:19,834
Ma'am.

349
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:21,779
Mr. President, you're gonna
have to come with me now.

350
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:22,947
Mrs. Kirkman, the Secret Service

351
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:24,482
will take you up to the residence now.

352
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,475
- Ma'am, please come with me.
- Mr. President.

353
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,478
- Right now.
- Please.

354
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:41,656
Aaron, where are we going?

355
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,457
The Presidential Emergency
Operations Center.

356
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,842
...every team we have worldwide.

357
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,011
I want every drone waiting on full staff

358
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,890
- and deployable as soon as
they get the order. - Excuse me.

359
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:07,114
Can you do that?

360
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:08,349
Well, get it done.

361
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:10,384
Excuse me.

362
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,689
Hey, hey! Hey!

363
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:18,993
I need you all to be quiet right now.

364
00:16:19,027 --> 00:16:21,162
Please.

365
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:23,631
Let's take a moment
for our fallen friends,

366
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:24,832
heroes one and all.

367
00:16:40,882 --> 00:16:42,850
Thank you.

368
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:46,954
Maybe we should go around the table.

369
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,490
Where's the CIA director?

370
00:16:49,524 --> 00:16:50,902
We're still working to
set up a secure comm.

371
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,093
The hell with secure comms.

372
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:54,028
We have to get him patched in now...

373
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:56,497
Cellphone, landline, Skype...
Whatever we got.

374
00:16:56,531 --> 00:16:57,565
Who's got the networks?

375
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,900
Okay, you tell them
we'll be live in 60 minutes

376
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,569
from the East Room, okay?

377
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,105
Nobody talks to any press
of any office or agency

378
00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:05,906
under threat of me ripping
your insides out.

379
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,608
Do we know who's responsible for this?

380
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:08,753
Still too early to determine.

381
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,054
We got to give them something, Karen.

382
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:11,810
The whole world is watching
us right now.

383
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:14,415
Exactly. We need to alert
every one of our embassies

384
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,417
to convey to each host nation

385
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:18,619
that the U.S. is on a war footing

386
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:20,788
and now is not the time to test us.

387
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:24,592
Patch me into 24-hour
watch at the Pentagon.

388
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:28,596
Inform the surviving joint
chiefs we are going to DEFCON 2.

389
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,807
You can't make that call.

390
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:31,766
The Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs is gone.

391
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,068
That doesn't give you
any authority, Harris.

392
00:17:34,102 --> 00:17:35,947
We're under attack. What more
authority do you want?

393
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:36,914
Who do you think you are?

394
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:39,540
I want the Air Force
flying in 15 minutes.

395
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:40,865
Who are you to give me orders?

396
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:42,543
Who are you to question them, Peter?

397
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:45,046
I'm not gonna sit on my ass
and hope for the best here.

398
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:05,966
Let it all out, man.

399
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,769
We're all feeling the same way tonight.

400
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:10,571
Sorry. I thought I was alone.

401
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:13,577
Yeah, well, nothing
is what it seems anymore.

402
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:15,820
You know, an hour ago, I
was throwing back tequila,

403
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,749
celebrating the three lines I
got into a 10,000-word speech.

404
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:20,648
Swear to God, I don't know how the hell

405
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,826
we're gonna get through this.

406
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,818
Same way we always do.

407
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,019
Yeah, right.

408
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:26,954
Do you even know who's
in charge right now?

409
00:18:26,988 --> 00:18:29,690
I'm asking, because I
can't even remember his name.

410
00:18:29,724 --> 00:18:31,492
Kirkman. Tom Kirkman.

411
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:34,128
Oh, yeah, yeah. Kirkland. That's right.

412
00:18:34,162 --> 00:18:36,664
The lowest rung on the ladder.

413
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,001
Did you know President Richmond
fired him this morning?

414
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,670
Now he's the President.

415
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,605
He's the one the country's
gonna be turning to

416
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:46,474
in our darkest hour.

417
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:50,611
Well, maybe he'll surprise you.

418
00:18:50,645 --> 00:18:54,715
Yeah, you mean maybe he'll realize

419
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:57,017
he has no business running the country?

420
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,121
That he should just step aside,

421
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:04,158
maybe let one of the generals
take over or the CIA director,

422
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:06,237
somebody who actually knows
what the hell they're doing?

423
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:10,531
Fat chance of that happening.

424
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:14,034
Nobody around here ever gives up power.

425
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,970
Kirkland's a follower.

426
00:19:16,004 --> 00:19:17,513
We need a leader.

427
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:20,051
I'm telling you, man, I got half
a mind to make a run to Canada.

428
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,675
You know what I'm saying?

429
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:24,712
Oh.

430
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,946
Canada.

431
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:29,316
Uh, Mr. President.

432
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,887
Do you really believe everything
you just said?

433
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,588
Uh, Mr. President, let me explain.

434
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:37,057
What's your name?

435
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,359
Seth Wright.

436
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:40,725
Seth Wright. You're a speechwriter.

437
00:19:40,873 --> 00:19:43,241
I saw you coming out of
Charlie's office earlier this morning.

438
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,766
You were arguing about
the President's address.

439
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,169
Uh, the AB-33 section.

440
00:19:49,704 --> 00:19:52,640
Housing reform.

441
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,078
You really think I should step down?

442
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,918
I do.

443
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,687
You may be right.

444
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:08,889
But for now, I'm all you got,

445
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:11,025
and you have...

446
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:13,227
exactly 52 minutes to write a speech

447
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:15,863
convincing the American people
that that's a good thing.

448
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:25,272
Penny!

449
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,574
Mommy!

450
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,630
All right, listen up.

451
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:51,966
No one comes in or out without tin.

452
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,802
I want a secure
perimeter, at least five blocks out.

453
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,938
I want TSA screening equipment
installed now.

454
00:20:57,973 --> 00:20:59,740
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

455
00:20:59,774 --> 00:21:01,041
All right, back to work.

456
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:03,744
You'll also want to send up
thermo UAVs and air sniffers

457
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:05,423
to look for anything biological
or radiological in the area.

458
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:07,648
Hannah, you were supposed
to report to HQ.

459
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:09,250
I was 10 blocks away.

460
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:11,752
Any survivors?

461
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:13,187
No, not yet.

462
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:15,289
EMS is digging through the rubble.

463
00:21:15,323 --> 00:21:17,258
Make sure that Haz-Mat knows...

464
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:20,160
Agent Wells, you're SIOC,
okay, you're not a field agent.

465
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,440
I need you heading up a crisis
team at the operations center.

466
00:21:22,464 --> 00:21:24,932
Don't need me behind a computer.
You need me here.

467
00:21:24,966 --> 00:21:26,767
- I worked both bomb sites...
- Hannah...

468
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:29,003
...on the ground in Brussels and Paris.

469
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,838
I know what to look for.

470
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:35,342
Jason... please, I need to be here.

471
00:21:41,716 --> 00:21:43,951
Nolan. Lawrence.

472
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:45,185
Yes, Deputy Director?

473
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,657
You're with Wells.

474
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:48,399
Anyone claiming responsibility?

475
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:49,356
No, not yet.

476
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,234
All right, Eric, I want
the license plates

477
00:21:51,235 --> 00:21:53,170
of every car parked in
the next three blocks scanned.

478
00:21:53,194 --> 00:21:55,729
If any of them are stolen or
owned by anyone on a watch list,

479
00:21:55,764 --> 00:21:56,730
you tear that car apart.

480
00:21:56,765 --> 00:21:58,365
Mark, bomb disposal techs, CSI,

481
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,801
we catalog what we find
and where we found it.

482
00:22:00,835 --> 00:22:02,303
Let's move.

483
00:22:36,957 --> 00:22:40,584
Thomas Adam Kirkman was
born December 29th, 1967,

484
00:22:40,618 --> 00:22:42,195
in Port Washington, New York.

485
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:43,353
Before being appointed

486
00:22:43,387 --> 00:22:45,789
Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development,

487
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,425
Kirkman worked in academia
as an educator...

488
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:49,626
This is insane.

489
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,071
Guy's never been elected to anything.

490
00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:53,563
He ran HUD. They find
affordable homes for people,

491
00:22:53,598 --> 00:22:55,865
which makes Kirkman a glorified
real-estate agent.

492
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,567
He was next in the line of succession.

493
00:22:57,602 --> 00:22:59,079
I'm sorry, but no one
could have foreseen this.

494
00:22:59,103 --> 00:23:00,464
Why the hell do you think

495
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:02,072
there's a designated survivor, Nikki?

496
00:23:02,106 --> 00:23:03,773
Because this was foreseen.

497
00:23:03,808 --> 00:23:05,942
Now shut up and let me work.

498
00:23:23,794 --> 00:23:25,795
Hey.

499
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,631
Hey.

500
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:29,666
What are you doing out here?

501
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,669
I just needed a minute.

502
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,237
How's Penny?

503
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:35,472
Ah, God.

504
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:37,674
Scared. Confused.

505
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,477
You know, I mean, just
like everyone, I guess.

506
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:42,746
Is this even happening?

507
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,750
What the hell am I doing here, Alex?

508
00:23:46,784 --> 00:23:49,786
I'm not the guy for this.

509
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:52,822
You want to quit?

510
00:23:52,857 --> 00:23:55,492
I know it's not the right thing to say,

511
00:23:55,526 --> 00:23:58,695
but I can't help but feel...

512
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,964
Like running for our lives.

513
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:03,833
Yeah.

514
00:24:03,868 --> 00:24:07,170
Tom, maybe we should.

515
00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:09,673
Look what happened tonight.

516
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:13,309
How many people... We
haven't even processed.

517
00:24:13,344 --> 00:24:15,712
And our kids?

518
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,181
Are we putting them in danger?

519
00:24:18,215 --> 00:24:21,217
I mean...

520
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,820
We're a target now.

521
00:24:23,854 --> 00:24:25,021
Are they?

522
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:26,856
I-I-I don't know...

523
00:24:26,891 --> 00:24:28,892
- Mr. President.
- Yeah?

524
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,960
You said Leo was at a
friend's house tonight.

525
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:32,295
Yeah, Caleb West.

526
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:33,907
I just spoke to our agents
at his residence

527
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:34,998
and Leo wasn't there.

528
00:24:35,032 --> 00:24:35,999
He never was.

529
00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:37,033
What?

530
00:24:37,068 --> 00:24:38,635
Where is he?

531
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:40,870
We don't know.

532
00:24:40,905 --> 00:24:42,739
They're gonna find Leo.

533
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:45,041
Mike knows him.

534
00:24:45,076 --> 00:24:47,644
Secret Service... They're
the best in the world at this.

535
00:24:50,581 --> 00:24:52,182
I know.

536
00:24:52,216 --> 00:24:54,184
Mr. President. This way, please.

537
00:24:54,218 --> 00:24:56,219
Please give me a sec.

538
00:24:57,755 --> 00:24:59,723
I got this.

539
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:09,566
After you.

540
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,904
This is Major Cameron.

541
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:18,074
Mr. President, this is
the nuclear football.

542
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:21,611
It'll be with you
whenever you leave the White House.

543
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,614
These are the launch codes,
verification codes,

544
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,683
a listing of every classified location

545
00:25:26,717 --> 00:25:29,085
capable of launching nuclear weapons.

546
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,920
In the event of an imminent strike,

547
00:25:30,955 --> 00:25:33,089
you can green-light
it using this phone.

548
00:25:33,124 --> 00:25:36,926
It works anywhere on Earth
as well as beneath it.

549
00:25:36,961 --> 00:25:40,230
Do you need my fingerprints
or an eye scan or something?

550
00:25:40,264 --> 00:25:43,032
No, sir. It's not like the movies.

551
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:44,234
It doesn't work that way.

552
00:25:45,803 --> 00:25:47,370
Of course.

553
00:25:47,404 --> 00:25:50,807
Mr. President, the UN
is in emergency session.

554
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,275
I have a three-page phone list

555
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:53,320
with every one of our enemies

556
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:56,146
calling to deny responsibility
for the attack.

557
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,381
All US military bases are on full alert,

558
00:25:58,415 --> 00:26:00,784
and the USS Eisenhower
is currently hard charging

559
00:26:00,818 --> 00:26:02,952
towards the Fifth Fleet
stationed in the Persian Gulf.

560
00:26:02,987 --> 00:26:04,197
I understand alerting our bases,

561
00:26:04,221 --> 00:26:07,924
but why are we "hard charging"
a US aircraft carrier anywhere?

562
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:09,436
Mr. President, in
the event of an attack...

563
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,627
An attack from who?

564
00:26:10,661 --> 00:26:13,797
Y-You just said all our enemies
are denying responsibility.

565
00:26:13,831 --> 00:26:15,765
Because all warfare
is based on deception

566
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,344
and there are still plenty
we haven't heard from.

567
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:20,303
I just don't feel comfortable
showing that kind of force yet.

568
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:22,005
With all due respect, sir,

569
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,263
would you mind telling us

570
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:26,142
when you do plan on being comfortable?

571
00:26:26,177 --> 00:26:28,311
You'll be the first to know, General.

572
00:26:28,345 --> 00:26:30,046
Excuse me.

573
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:46,830
Pleasure doing business with you.

574
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,149
So, how many more bags you got?

575
00:26:56,173 --> 00:26:57,273
I just sold my last two.

576
00:26:57,308 --> 00:26:58,374
Still got three left.

577
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,176
Save 'em. We got to bounce anyway.

578
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:01,811
Screw that.

579
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:03,713
I came here to make money
and have some fun.

580
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:13,857
- Leo!
- Get off me, man!

581
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,160
Mike?

582
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:18,995
What are you doing here?

583
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,369
How'd you find me?

584
00:27:26,403 --> 00:27:27,503
It wasn't easy.

585
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:30,206
We had to open up an ops center at NSA,

586
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:31,908
run the phone records
of all your friends

587
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,209
and classmates through PRISM

588
00:27:33,244 --> 00:27:35,222
till we could piece together
enough chatter keywords

589
00:27:35,246 --> 00:27:37,313
to trace your digital
footprint to the club.

590
00:27:37,348 --> 00:27:39,215
Really?

591
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,017
No, Leo.

592
00:27:41,051 --> 00:27:43,052
We pinged your phone.

593
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:46,689
You're not exactly
a criminal mastermind.

594
00:27:51,195 --> 00:27:55,098
I thought you were taking me home.

595
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,033
I am.

596
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:01,170
Everyone is at a
complete loss for words.

597
00:28:01,205 --> 00:28:02,338
This is the most devastating

598
00:28:02,373 --> 00:28:03,840
attack on our country since 9/11.

599
00:28:03,874 --> 00:28:05,323
And staffers at the White House

600
00:28:05,324 --> 00:28:08,278
are asking the same question
as the rest of the country.

601
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:11,247
Who's behind this
horrific act of terror?

602
00:28:11,282 --> 00:28:13,082
Look, can you please just check again?

603
00:28:13,117 --> 00:28:14,284
My name is Emily Rhodes.

604
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,286
I am Secretary Kirkman's Chief of Staff.

605
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,942
He was the designated survivor tonight.

606
00:28:17,943 --> 00:28:19,766
Look, I already told you
you're not on the cleared list.

607
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,257
I was just in there this morning.

608
00:28:21,292 --> 00:28:22,402
Well, a lot's happened since then,

609
00:28:22,426 --> 00:28:23,760
in case you haven't noticed.

610
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,129
Step back from the gate.

611
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,865
Intelligence sources
are being tight-lipped

612
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:30,867
about what has happened
at the Capitol today,

613
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:33,970
but as of yet, no one has
claimed responsibility

614
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,272
and our nation remains on high alert.

615
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:39,142
Thank you for your prayers,
Madam Prime Minister.

616
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,410
You, too.

617
00:28:40,444 --> 00:28:42,879
Goodbye.

618
00:28:42,913 --> 00:28:44,113
Right, where were we?

619
00:28:44,148 --> 00:28:45,815
Uh, the presidential voice.

620
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,918
Which, apparently, I don't have.

621
00:28:48,953 --> 00:28:51,287
You can defend my honor at any time.

622
00:28:51,322 --> 00:28:54,324
I will... when he says
something I disagree with.

623
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,960
Okay, so, what do you think
the presidential voice is?

624
00:28:56,994 --> 00:28:59,562
Uh, "All of us here know
there is work to be done.

625
00:28:59,596 --> 00:29:00,997
We have a responsibility

626
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,132
to light the way for every American."

627
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:04,500
Sounds good to me.

628
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:07,303
I imagine it would.
You said it two years ago

629
00:29:07,338 --> 00:29:10,406
in Atlanta at the Conference
for the New Urbanism.

630
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:15,196
Sir, tonight, you're
speaking to the world.

631
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:17,524
America doesn't need
another friend right now.

632
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:19,148
You can't be relaxed or disarming.

633
00:29:19,183 --> 00:29:20,950
That's gonna work anymore.

634
00:29:20,985 --> 00:29:23,453
Mr. President, you need to be

635
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:26,155
stronger than you've ever been before.

636
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,124
We all need that right now.

637
00:29:31,495 --> 00:29:33,463
What is it, Tom?

638
00:29:33,497 --> 00:29:35,465
I've got to go.

639
00:29:39,336 --> 00:29:41,037
Just sit down.

640
00:29:43,474 --> 00:29:46,175
It's okay. We're all feeling it.

641
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,011
Thank you, ma'am.

642
00:29:48,045 --> 00:29:49,512
Alex, please.

643
00:29:49,546 --> 00:29:52,115
Uh, no, ma'am.

644
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:54,117
You're the First Lady.

645
00:29:58,222 --> 00:29:59,122
Hey.

646
00:29:59,156 --> 00:30:01,624
No, no. Please, sit down.

647
00:30:01,658 --> 00:30:04,193
Sat imagery shows 10
Iranian Navy destroyers

648
00:30:04,228 --> 00:30:05,962
leaving Bandar Abbas port

649
00:30:05,996 --> 00:30:08,531
and taking up positions along
the Strait of Hormuz.

650
00:30:08,565 --> 00:30:09,409
The Strait of Hormuz is where

651
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,401
30% of the world's oil passes through.

652
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,412
I know what it is, Aaron.

653
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:15,338
Mr. President, this is
a purposeful provocation

654
00:30:15,372 --> 00:30:18,207
by the Iranians to take
advantage of the night's events

655
00:30:18,242 --> 00:30:21,978
and choke off the Western
world's main supply of oil.

656
00:30:22,012 --> 00:30:23,379
Just as we're on our knees,

657
00:30:23,414 --> 00:30:25,415
they're gonna step on our throat.

658
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,430
Aaron.

659
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,642
I finally got past
the gate. What's going on?

660
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,444
I can't talk right now, Emily.
I need to get back to the PEOC.

661
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:38,279
- Is Tom gonna be in there?
- Well, it is his meeting.

662
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,447
Well, then I'm coming with you.

663
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,772
Sorry, Emily, but in there,
it's code-word clearance only.

664
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:43,517
I've been with Secretary
Kirkman's staff for three years.

665
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,043
It's President Kirkman now,
and you're not authorized.

666
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:48,089
If you are choosing this moment
for a pissing contest, Aaron...

667
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,014
That's my point, Emily.
This is no contest.

668
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,116
Now, if you'll excuse me...

669
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,419
President Kirkman needs
people he knows by his side.

670
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:56,854
You and I have our differences.

671
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,023
I know. And you don't want me in there.

672
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,258
But you also know
better than anyone else

673
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,928
why it is important that I
am there for him right now.

674
00:31:08,086 --> 00:31:09,410
How many more ways can I say this?

675
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,937
In the morning, our economy
is going to go over a cliff,

676
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:16,240
and the Iranians are just
seizing the moment.

677
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:17,775
What do you want me to do, General?

678
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,476
Declare war?

679
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:20,611
Why not?

680
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,113
40 minutes ago, they
showed me the nuclear football.

681
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:25,983
I guess I've had it
long enough to try it out.

682
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,384
We've just been attacked.

683
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,420
The world thinks it can
test us right now,

684
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,289
and a full, swift show of force
is the only way to remind them

685
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:34,425
that our flag is still
flying strong tonight.

686
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,826
And all I'm saying is that I think

687
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,494
there are different ways to show force.

688
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,130
What you need to understand
is the Iranians respect

689
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:42,967
only one course of action,
and that is action.

690
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,501
This is not some consumer group

691
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,971
waiting for a photo
op with a figurehead.

692
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,976
Figurehead.

693
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,210
Well, General,

694
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,913
this figurehead paid attention
during the Cabinet meetings,

695
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,581
where we dealt with this very issue.

696
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:00,150
And the Iranians have tried to
close off the Strait of Hormuz

697
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:01,585
for the last 35 years,

698
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,021
so I am having a difficult
time believing

699
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,523
that they just up and decided
to do that tonight.

700
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,126
And how can you be so certain of that?

701
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:22,606
When is the Iranian ambassador
due to arrive?

702
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,441
15 minutes.

703
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:25,676
Okay, General.

704
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,513
You can scramble your bombers,
but they are not to engage.

705
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:34,018
We are going to do this my way.

706
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,020
If it doesn't work, we'll try yours.

707
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:43,527
I know you're scared, peanut,
but everything's gonna be okay.

708
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,996
But why are we here?

709
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:52,069
'Cause this, uh... this
is gonna be our new home.

710
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,204
But why?

711
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:59,043
Because some bad people
did something bad tonight,

712
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:02,212
and it's Dad's job to make
sure we're all safe.

713
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,481
Are you scared?

714
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:06,150
Yeah.

715
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:09,920
Is Daddy?

716
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,022
Are you kidding?

717
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:15,559
Dad's not scared of anything.

718
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,105
Hi. This is Scott.

719
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,250
I'm not available right now.

720
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:30,684
Please leave me a message
after the beep.

721
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,578
It's me again.

722
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,246
Where are you?

723
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:39,349
Please call me back and...
And tell me you're okay.

724
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,553
I love you.

725
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:45,322
Agent Wells. I was looking for you.

726
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,426
Are you okay?

727
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,428
Yeah.

728
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,230
Did you lose someone?

729
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,934
I think we all lost someone.

730
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,402
What do you got?

731
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,938
I-I checked all the license
plates in the area

732
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,306
against every watch list.

733
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,941
Nothing so far.

734
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,086
All right, get in touch with the NSA.

735
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,120
Make sure that they know...

736
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:09,279
We got something over here!

737
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:12,082
- What do we got?
- UXO! We got a UXO!

738
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,084
Clear the perimeter!

739
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:16,453
All right. Clear the area!

740
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,088
We've got a bomb!

741
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:19,990
Back up now!

742
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:21,425
Clear the area now!

743
00:34:31,477 --> 00:34:33,111
Perimeter is secure.

744
00:34:33,145 --> 00:34:34,312
You may proceed.

745
00:34:34,347 --> 00:34:36,314
Copy that.

746
00:34:41,053 --> 00:34:43,321
All clear. Open it up.

747
00:34:43,356 --> 00:34:46,024
Okay. Removing the outer case.

748
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:59,471
Hemostat.

749
00:35:03,242 --> 00:35:06,311
What do you see?

750
00:35:06,345 --> 00:35:09,247
Wires to the fuze compartment,

751
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:12,350
to the creep spring,

752
00:35:12,385 --> 00:35:14,319
to the detonator.

753
00:35:14,353 --> 00:35:16,388
But no pressure plate.

754
00:35:16,422 --> 00:35:19,124
Easy.

755
00:35:23,095 --> 00:35:25,830
It's clear.

756
00:35:25,865 --> 00:35:27,732
Bomb's a dud.

757
00:35:36,142 --> 00:35:37,942
Is he here?

758
00:35:37,977 --> 00:35:40,078
Yes, he's... he's waiting just outside.

759
00:35:40,112 --> 00:35:42,881
Send him in.

760
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,751
Mr. Ambassador.

761
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:50,088
Mr. Ambassador.

762
00:35:50,122 --> 00:35:52,056
Mr. President.

763
00:35:52,091 --> 00:35:53,057
Please.

764
00:35:53,092 --> 00:35:55,460
Thank you.

765
00:35:55,494 --> 00:35:58,963
Please, allow me to begin

766
00:35:58,998 --> 00:36:01,966
by extending to you
and the American people

767
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:04,269
my country's most sincere sympathies

768
00:36:04,303 --> 00:36:06,271
on this horrific tragedy.

769
00:36:06,305 --> 00:36:08,473
If there is anything our people can do

770
00:36:08,507 --> 00:36:12,410
in response to this
tremendous act of cowardice,

771
00:36:12,445 --> 00:36:14,279
rest assured, we will do it.

772
00:36:14,313 --> 00:36:16,948
I appreciate that.

773
00:36:16,982 --> 00:36:18,817
You can begin by
removing your destroyers

774
00:36:18,851 --> 00:36:20,452
from the Strait of Hormuz.

775
00:36:20,486 --> 00:36:23,388
Mr. President, excuse me,

776
00:36:23,422 --> 00:36:26,391
but I believe you have been misinformed.

777
00:36:26,425 --> 00:36:27,892
Is that a fact?

778
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:29,127
Yes. We... We have moved

779
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:31,596
no such destroyers into
the Strait of Hormuz.

780
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,132
My defense department
has war-gamed this out.

781
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,911
They're waiting for me to
give them the green light,

782
00:36:35,935 --> 00:36:37,836
which, I assure you, I will do

783
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:40,171
unless you pull your destroyers
back to Bandar Abbas

784
00:36:40,206 --> 00:36:41,973
within the next three hours.

785
00:36:42,007 --> 00:36:43,007
Mr. President, I would...

786
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:46,478
Mr. Ambassador, you
may not know much about me,

787
00:36:46,512 --> 00:36:47,912
but what you should know

788
00:36:47,947 --> 00:36:49,191
is that I'm about as straight a shooter

789
00:36:49,215 --> 00:36:51,282
as you're gonna find in Washington.

790
00:36:51,317 --> 00:36:54,152
So you should believe me when
I tell you that I do not want,

791
00:36:54,186 --> 00:36:58,523
as my first act as Commander
in Chief, to attack Iran.

792
00:36:58,557 --> 00:37:00,325
But as both of us know,

793
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:03,595
it's not always up to us
how history plays itself out.

794
00:37:03,629 --> 00:37:05,430
Now, I have chosen to believe

795
00:37:05,464 --> 00:37:08,500
that your country is not playing
on our emotions tonight,

796
00:37:08,534 --> 00:37:10,645
but nevertheless, you will
feel the full impact of them

797
00:37:10,669 --> 00:37:12,871
if you do not comply with my demands.

798
00:37:12,905 --> 00:37:16,140
Mr. Ambassador, dock your destroyers

799
00:37:16,175 --> 00:37:18,510
or the lead story on the morning news

800
00:37:18,544 --> 00:37:21,446
will not be about
the attack on our capital

801
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,948
but the devastating attack on yours.

802
00:37:23,983 --> 00:37:26,217
Please, Mr. Ambassador,

803
00:37:26,252 --> 00:37:29,521
let's not get off on
the wrong foot here tonight.

804
00:37:29,555 --> 00:37:34,025
Mr. President, I will speak
with my government.

805
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:36,127
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

806
00:37:37,396 --> 00:37:39,864
Mr. Ambassador, this way.

807
00:37:43,002 --> 00:37:45,169
Mr. Ambassador.

808
00:37:47,006 --> 00:37:48,873
Three hours.

809
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:15,567
Haven't seen one of those before.

810
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:18,069
It's a Soviet-era anti-tank mine.

811
00:38:18,103 --> 00:38:20,071
There are still
thousands of them in Afghanistan.

812
00:38:20,105 --> 00:38:22,017
Jihadist terror groups
have been using them for years

813
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:24,075
as their primary IEDs.

814
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:25,710
Hannah, you hearing this?

815
00:38:25,744 --> 00:38:27,946
Agent Wells, the bomb is...

816
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,691
Is an unexploded
munition you think was used

817
00:38:29,715 --> 00:38:31,082
by a Mideast terror group...

818
00:38:31,116 --> 00:38:32,951
Either ISIS, Al-Qaeda, or the Taliban...

819
00:38:32,985 --> 00:38:34,285
To blow up our Capitol.

820
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,120
Yes, I heard you.

821
00:38:36,155 --> 00:38:38,222
And that's one theory.

822
00:38:38,257 --> 00:38:39,691
You got another one?

823
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:42,660
All right.

824
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,296
In the weeks
leading up to the big ones...

825
00:38:45,331 --> 00:38:47,432
9/11, Paris, Belgium...

826
00:38:47,466 --> 00:38:49,306
The chatter we were getting
was off the charts.

827
00:38:49,335 --> 00:38:50,602
Something was coming, you know?

828
00:38:50,636 --> 00:38:52,537
We just didn't know what it was.

829
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:54,639
Do you know what I'm hearing now?

830
00:38:54,673 --> 00:38:56,274
Nothing.

831
00:38:56,308 --> 00:38:58,576
No breaks in any of the routines

832
00:38:58,611 --> 00:39:00,144
of the mosques or camps we're inside,

833
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:02,246
no one is relocated
their wives or children

834
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:04,616
in anticipation of our counterattacks.

835
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,317
It's business as usual.

836
00:39:06,352 --> 00:39:08,453
That makes no sense.

837
00:39:08,487 --> 00:39:10,388
So, you're saying the bomb
isn't one of theirs.

838
00:39:10,422 --> 00:39:12,223
I'm saying that if they did this,

839
00:39:12,257 --> 00:39:13,625
they'd be crowing right now.

840
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:16,260
There is a reason
the people who did this

841
00:39:16,295 --> 00:39:17,562
are keeping silent about it.

842
00:39:17,596 --> 00:39:19,597
And that is?

843
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:24,268
You don't take credit for something

844
00:39:24,303 --> 00:39:25,603
until you're done, right?

845
00:39:27,106 --> 00:39:29,140
So, what if they're
just getting started?

846
00:39:36,649 --> 00:39:39,684
I don't remember this suit.

847
00:39:39,718 --> 00:39:42,487
I had to borrow it.

848
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,329
You look the part.

849
00:39:51,363 --> 00:39:54,332
I know this is gonna
change everything for us,

850
00:39:54,366 --> 00:39:57,635
but I have to do it.

851
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,303
If I don't...

852
00:40:02,207 --> 00:40:05,543
I just have to.

853
00:40:05,577 --> 00:40:07,779
You still on my side?

854
00:40:07,813 --> 00:40:11,516
I'm always on your side...

855
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,284
Mr. President.

856
00:40:15,054 --> 00:40:16,521
Something needs to be done, Aaron.

857
00:40:16,555 --> 00:40:19,357
I think we're doing
everything that's expected of us, Harris.

858
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:21,526
That's not what I'm talking about.

859
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:28,066
What exactly are you talking about here?

860
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,734
Because if it's what I think it is,

861
00:40:29,768 --> 00:40:32,503
this conversation's going to
be treading dangerously close

862
00:40:32,538 --> 00:40:34,138
to conspiracy to commit treason.

863
00:40:34,173 --> 00:40:36,374
We have a Housing and Urban
Development Secretary

864
00:40:36,408 --> 00:40:38,142
running the free world.

865
00:40:38,177 --> 00:40:39,210
You call it treason.

866
00:40:39,244 --> 00:40:41,345
I call it my civic responsibility.

867
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,215
You're talking about
removing a sitting president.

868
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:46,150
An unelected president, yes.

869
00:40:46,185 --> 00:40:47,629
Listen to me.

870
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:49,397
If the country's gonna survive,

871
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:52,390
we need to act swiftly and definitively.

872
00:40:52,424 --> 00:40:54,592
Tom Kirkman will not
get us through this.

873
00:40:54,626 --> 00:40:56,728
And let me guess... You can?

874
00:40:56,762 --> 00:40:58,730
We're in a state of war.

875
00:40:58,764 --> 00:41:01,065
Who would you rather have leading us?

876
00:41:25,557 --> 00:41:27,692
Uh, Mr. President.

877
00:41:27,726 --> 00:41:30,261
Your glasses.

878
00:41:30,295 --> 00:41:31,896
They're not very presidential, sir.

879
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,433
Right.

880
00:41:35,467 --> 00:41:37,268
Thank you.

881
00:41:42,641 --> 00:41:47,512
Mr. President, you're live
in five, four, three...

882
00:41:49,281 --> 00:41:50,615
My fellow Americans...

883
00:41:50,838 --> 00:41:55,256
